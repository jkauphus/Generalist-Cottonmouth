# Abstract

1.Wetlands are typically transitional habitats that represent a dynamic hydrologic gradient between terrestrial and aquatic systems. As hydrologic fluctuations within a wetland can cause the habitat to become periodically unsuitable and resource-limited, species with traits that can adapt to these environmental changes will be favored. Populations inhabiting highly dynamic environments with high frequencies of disturbance may have extensive niche overlap and less habitat specialization among residents. This study examined the habitat selection of cottonmouths inhabiting an isolated riverine slough along the Cumberland River (Middle Tennessee). We hypothesize that cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorus) use generalist habitat selection as an adaptation to hydrologically-dynamic ecosystems, and have extensive habitat niche overlap as a result of temporal instability of habitat resources.

2.Field collection was by visual-encounter surveys and environmental (abiotic and biotic) variables were recorded for each observed snake location (N = 149) and paired with a random location to assess available habitats and microhabitats within the study area. 

3.Multivariate analysis found that the cottonmouths have a broad preference for a variety of microhabitats within the riverine slough. In addition, we found no intra-specific differences in habitat use between adult males and females. However, there was an ontogenetic shift with younger individuals selecting more terrestrial habitats with appropriate cover objects. 

4.Random Forest modeling determined that cottonmouths tended to select sites associated near or within water, even though fully terrestrial habitats were available, emphasizing cottonmouths preference for wetland ecosystems.

5.Our findings suggest that the stochastic hydrologic regime of the study area has promoted cottonmouths to exhibit a generalist habitat strategy to increase the opportunity to obtain resources in an unstable environment.
