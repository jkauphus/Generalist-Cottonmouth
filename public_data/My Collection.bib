abstract = {Mining for heavy metals usually has a strong impact on the environment, including the formation of spoil heaps, mine tailings and mine drainage, all of which are heavily contaminated. Heavy metals are generally regarded as toxic for most organisms, including amphibians, although the effects of heavy metals may be extremely complex and sometimes even positive. This study presents a survey of observations of amphibians in habitats severely contaminated by mining for heavy metals in Central and Eastern Europe. Rocky spoil heaps and sandy mine tailings were generally found to be devoid of amphibians. In moist habitats, especially streams, puddles and ponds fed by drainage water, however, six species of amphibians were observed, i.e., Bombina variegata, Rana ridibunda, R. temporaria, Bufo viridis, Salamandra salamandra and S. atra. All six species were found in habitats superficially similar to their typically preferred habitats, e.g., Bombina varie­gata in small puddles, Salamandra salamandra larvae in a swiftly running stream. Moderately increased concentrations of copper, arsenic, antimony and other elements and an acidic pH of soil and water did not keep amphibians away. Highly contaminated or extremely acidic water bodies are usually devoid of amphibians even though they may be present in the surroundings, suggesting that amphibians may be capable of recognising and avoiding extreme degrees of contamination. With the uptake of the pollutants being highly probable, some amphibians appear to possess a limited tolerance against heavy metals.},

abstract = {Species in the suborder Serpentes present a powerful model for understanding processes involved in visual signal design. Although vision is generally poor in snakes, they are often both predators and prey of visually oriented species. We examined how ecological and behavioral factors have driven the evolution of snake patterning using a phylogenetic comparative approach. The appearances of 171 species of Australian and North American snakes were classified using a reaction-diffusion model of pattern development, the parameters of which allow parametric quantification of various aspects of coloration. The main findings include associations between plain color and an active hunting strategy, longitudinal stripes and rapid escape speed, blotched patterns with ambush hunting, slow movement and pungent cloacal defense, and spotted patterns with close proximity to cover. Expected associations between bright colors, aggressive behavior, and venom potency were not observed. The mechanisms through which plain and longitudinally striped patterns might support camouflage during movement are discussed. The flicker-fusion hypothesis for transverse striped patterns being perceived as uniform color during movement is evaluated as theoretically possible but unlikely. Snake pattern evolution is generally phylogenetically conservative, but by sampling densely in a wide variety of snake lineages, we have demonstrated that similar pattern phenotypes have evolved repeatedly in response to similar ecological demands.},

abstract = {Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description pro- vided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test- statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

abstract = {Beta diversity can be defined as the variability in species composition among sampling units for a given area. We propose that it can be measured as the average dissimilarity from individual observation units to their group centroid in multivariate space, using an appropriate dissimilarity measure. Differences in beta diversity among different areas or groups of samples can be tested using this approach. The choice of transformation and dissimilarity measure has important consequences for interpreting results. For kelp holdfast assemblages from New Zealand, variation in species composition was greater in smaller holdfasts, while variation in relative abundances was greater in larger holdasts. Variation in community structure of Norwegian continental shelf macrobenthic fauna increased with increases in environmental heterogeneity, regardless of the measure used. We propose a new dissimilarity measure which allows the relative weight placed on changes in composition vs. abundance to be specified explicitly. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Microarray studies yield data sets consisting of a large number of candidate predictors (genes) on a small number of observations (samples). When interest lies in predicting phenotypic class using gene expression data, often the goals are both to produce an accurate classifier and to uncover the predictive structure of the problem. Most machine learning methods, such as k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks, are useful for classification. However, these methods provide no insight regarding the covariates that best contribute to the predictive structure. Other methods, such as linear discriminant analysis, require the predictor space be substantially reduced prior to deriving the classifier. A recently developed method, random forests (RF), does not require reduction of the predictor space prior to classification. Additionally, RF yield variable importance measures for each candidate predictor. This study examined the effectiveness of RF variable importance measures in identifying the true predictor among a large number of candidate predictors. An extensive simulation study was conducted using 20 levels of correlation among the predictor variables and 7 levels of association between the true predictor and the dichotomous response. We conclude that the RF methodology is attractive for use in classification problems when the goals of the study are to produce an accurate classifier and to provide insight regarding the discriminative ability of individual predictor variables. Such goals are common among microarray studies, and therefore application of the RF methodology for the purpose of obtaining variable importance measures is demonstrated on a microarray data set. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Visual standardised methods for census of reef fishes have long been used in fisheries management and biological surveys. However, these tools have inherent sources of bias and the SCUBA divers who perform them are highly constrained in terms of survey time, maximum depth and frequency of sampling. Alternatives like underwater video are thus being recommended in a wide range of configurations. Yet, all these techniques are still limited in field of view, particularly when compared to the ability of a SCUBA diver performing censuses. In this scope, we evaluated the potential of an underwater wide-angle camera (UWC) to survey fish assemblages by testing it against instantaneous underwater visual census (UVC). Our results showed minimal yet significant differences between methods, mainly because of the camera's loss of resolution when under extreme visibility conditions. Both approaches had the same consistency and ability to detect changes in fish assemblages but, to estimate total species richness, the UWC needed less field effort. Moreover, a SCUBA diver performing census had an effect on fish assemblages which introduced differences of greater magnitude than those found between methods. The removal of the diver effect, the proven ability to detect changes in fish assemblages and the verified gain in field effort, pointed the wide-angle camera as a promising tool to perform census of reef fishes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Pesticides and fertilizers negatively affect many amphibian species and can cause mortality and sublethal effects, such as reduced growth and increased susceptibility to disease. However, the effect of pesticides and fertilizers varies among amphibian species. We used meta-analytic techniques to quantify the lethal and sublethal effects of pesticides and fertilizers on amphibians in an effort to review the published work to date and produce generalized conclusions. We found that pesticides and fertilizers had a negative effect on survival of. 0.9027 and growth of. 0.0737 across all reported amphibian species. We also observed differences between chemical classes in their impact on amphibians: inorganic fertilizers, organophosphates, chloropyridinyl, phosphonoglycines, carbamates, and triazines negatively affected amphibian survival, while organophosphates and phosphonoglycines negatively affected amphibian growth. Our results suggest that pesticides and fertilizers are an important stressor for amphibians in agriculturally dominated systems. Furthermore, certain chemical classes are more likely to harm amphibians. Best management practices in agroecosystems should incorporate amphibian species-specific response to agrochemicals as well as life stage dependent susceptibility to best conserve amphibian biodiversity in these landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The fish assemblages of an arid zone floodplain river, Cooper Creek, Queensland, Australia, were sampled during two dry periods in isolated waterholes and on the inundated floodplain during the early and late phase of a major flood event. Diets were described for nine native species and compared within and between dry and flood periods. In the dry season, when fishes were restricted to waterholes, diets were characteristically simple with narrow diet breadths. Movement onto the floodplain during flooding clearly increased feeding opportunities, with greater diet breadths evident in all species. Despite obvious potential for terrestrial inputs, diets tended to be dominated by aquatic resources in both the waterholes and on the floodplain. Stomach fullness, however, varied little between dry season waterhole and floodplain samples. Fishes appeared to feed on potentially lower value resources such as detritus and calanoid copepods during the dry season, when waterholes were isolated and food resources were limited. They were then able to capitalize on the 'boom' of aquatic production and more diverse food resources associated with episodic flood events. {\textcopyright} The Fisheries Society of the British Isles, 2005.},

Larvae-juvenile transition was determined between 22.4 and 29.4 mm standard length (SL), on the basis of the relative growth changes and morphogenesis, and juvenile-adult shift was established between 61 and 65 mm SL using a macroscopic criterion of gonadal development and gonadosomatic index. Spawning period was estimated to be in the summer season, from December to February. Larvae preferred shallow marginal pools and fed mainly on small Chironomidae larvae, while juveniles and adults inhabited riffles and preyed on Ephemeroptera nymphs and Chironomid larvae. Morphological constraints during the larval period were related to habitat and feeding preferences. A complete development of fins allowed juveniles to colonise faster water habitats while a bigger mouth gape permitted them to prey on new items and on a larger size prey range. {\textcopyright} 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract = {Eastern Indigo Snakes (EIS, Drymarchon couperi) and Eastern Diamondbacked Rattlesnakes (EDB, Crotalus adamanteus) are species of conservation concern, in large part attributable to anthropogenic landscape changes within the southeastern Coastal Plain of North America. Both species use Gopher Tortoise ( Gopherus polyphemus) burrows on xeric sandhills for winter retreat sites. Protected lands play an important role in the conservation of threatened species by offering the potential to conserve potentially limiting resources such as sandhills. We surveyed 40 randomly selected xeric sandhills containing Gopher Tortoise burrows on protected lands throughout the Lower Altamaha River Watershed in southern Georgia using visual encounter surveys over three winters (November through March). We used single-season occupancy models to relate detection and occupancy rates to survey- and site-specific covariates collected at both the sandhill- and landscape-scale. Eastern Indigo Snake occupancy was positively related to the number of Gopher Tortoise burrows and the amount of surrounding sandhill habitat. In contrast, EDB occupancy was not associated with any of the covariates we considered, perhaps because EDB/EIS use a greater diversity of winter retreat sites. Detection of EIS was higher than EDB (0.40 vs. 0.22) and most influenced by air temperature, whereas EDB detection was most influenced by survey date. Our study provides previously lacking population-level detection rates and habitat associations for EIS and corroborates the previously noted importance of Gopher Tortoise burrows as overwintering retreat sites. Our study also illustrates the potential shortcomings of monitoring multiple species using survey methodologies designed for a single species. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The principal goal of protected area networks is biodiversity preservation, but efficacy of such networks is directly linked to animal movement within and outside area boundaries. We examined wetland selection patterns of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) during non-breeding periods from 2010 to 2012 to evaluate the utility of protected areas to migratory waterfowl in North America. We tracked 33 adult females using global positioning system (GPS) satellite transmitters and implemented a use-availability resource selection design to examine mallard use of wetlands under varying degrees of protection. Specifically, we examined effects of proximities to National Wildlife Refuges, private land, state wildlife management areas, Wetland Reserve Program easements (WRP), and waterfowl sanctuaries on mallard wetland selection. In addition, we included landscape-level variables that measured areas of sanctuary and WRP within the surrounding landscape of each used and available wetland. We developed 8 wetland selection models according to season (autumn migration, winter, spring migration), hunting season (present, absent), and time period (diurnal, nocturnal). Model averaged parameter estimates indicated wetland selection patterns varied across seasons and time periods, but ducks consistently selected wetlands with greater areas of sanctuary and WRP in the surrounding landscape. Consequently, WRP has the potential to supplement protected area networks in the midcontinent region. Additionally, seasonal variation in wetland selection patterns indicated considering the effects of habitat management and anthropogenic disturbances on migratory waterfowl during the non-breeding period is essential in designing protected area networks. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {I investigated habitat use, home ranges, activity patterns, thermal biology, and energetics of sympatric western diamondback (Crotalus atrox), black-tailed (C. molossus), and tiger rattlesnakes (C tigris) in the Sonoran desert of southeastern Arizona. The three species differed significantly in their choice of habitats, and habitats used by snakes were significantly influenced by season. Crotalus atrox used mainly creosotebush flats, but switched to rocky slopes during winter. Crotalus molossus frequented rocky areas, but during late summer and fall used arroyos and creosotebush flats. Crotalus tigris was a strict rock dweller during winter and spring, but used edges of arroyos during summer. Crotalus atrox, C. molossus, and C. tigris had mean home range sizes of 5.42 ha, 3.49 ha, and 3.48 ha, respectively. Over the year, snakes traveled a mean distance of 12.94 km (C. atrox), 14.99 km (C. molossus), and 9.29 km (C tigris) during approximately 95 h of surface activity. During their active seasons, 1 March to 15 October, rattle- snakes traveled, on average, 50.8 m/d (C. atrox), 42.9 m/d (C. molossus), and 32.9 m/d (C tigris). All three species had mean activity temperatures near 29.5 C. The three species showed no significant differences in home range, activity distances, or body temperatures. Rattlesnakes had standard metabolic rates similar to those of other Crotalus species, but only 40% those of other squamate reptiles of similar mass. They could fulfill yearly maintenance energy requirements with a prey quantity equivalent to 93% of their body mass; these energy demands could be met with 2 to 3 large m},

abstract = {1.Floodplain wetlands are productive components of lowland rivers and are thought to be important habitat and nurseries for many fish species. Fish assemblages inhabiting floodplain wetlands vary considerably through space and time and are largely shaped by wetting/drying cycles, although there is little understanding how many aspects of flooding (e.g. magnitude, timing, duration, frequency) influence the fish assemblages. As a consequence, decisions on flooding of wetlands by managers aimed at restoring native fish assemblages are often based on limited knowledge. 2.This study examined the importance of total duration of flooding on the temporal and spatial dynamics of wetland fish assemblages in the Murray River, in south-eastern Australia. The study examined: (i) how the abundance of 0+ and 1+ fish varied with wetland, season and the duration of wetland filling; (ii) how environmental parameters, including food production changed in relation to the duration of wetland filling; (iii) changes in condition indices for the most abundant species and (iv) changes in species richness and total abundance over time. 3.The 0+ fish assemblage varied more through space and time than the 1+ assemblage. Longer cumulative river-wetland filling was associated with greater total abundances of newly recruited (0+) fish; this was particularly true for common carp (Cyprinus carpio, alien) and carp gudgeon (Hypseleotris spp., native). The body condition of carp gudgeon also increased with the duration of filling, even though static measures of food production declined. The small flooding events that occurred as part of this study did not translate into measurable improvements in the fish assemblage over the longer term (3years), but did prevent wetlands from drying and thus maintained these habitats as refuges. {\textcopyright} 2012 State of Victoria.},

abstract = {Habitat selection is an inherently scale-sensitive process in which detected selection patterns frequently depend on the scale of analysis employed. We used a multi-scale modelling approach to identify how the distributions of two sympatric birds are shaped by differential selection at the landscape, land use and microhabitat scales and by human infrastructures as possible sources of disturbance. We studied two threatened steppe birds, the pin-tailed sandgrouse (PTS) and black-bellied sandgrouse (BBS) in central Spain. Land use gradients explained most of the variation in PTS and BBS occurrence, but there was cross-scale interdependence between the lower (microhabitat) and upper (landscape) spatial scales for the PTS. Synergies between the three scales highlighted the importance of integrating habitat scales in a single modelling framework. The process of habitat selection was also modulated by human disturbance. Both species selected ploughs of large size distant from houses, tracks and other infrastructures, although BBS exhibited broader habitat tolerance than the PTS, and was more sensitive to human disturbance. At microhabitat scale, PTS selected ploughs with greater green vegetation cover and insect abundance and fallows with lower dry vegetation cover and height but greater stone cover. This might reflect a trade-off between camouflage (vegetation and stone cover for concealment) and visibility for predator detection and escape. Ploughs and fallows should be maintained by means of traditional 2-year rotations and low management during the breeding season. Ongoing urbanization trends and infrastructure development inside protected areas should be limited. Multi-scale models were key to identify scale-specific factors that determine sandgrouse habitat preferences and conservation requirements at appropriate levels, and are recommended to better guide regional and local conservation efforts of threatened species.},

abstract = {We investigated the use of aquatic and terrestrial floodplain habitats by lentic and lotic turtles inhabiting the Missouri River, a contemporary, regulated large river. Specifically, we tested whether habitats were used differentially by turtle species, sexes, and life stages over biologically determined spatial and temporal scales. We monitored female and male false map turtles (Graptemys pseudogeographica) and slider turtles (Trachemys scripta) for 14 months, using radiotelemetry. In addition, over a 3-year period we trapped G. pseudogeographica (n=591) and T. scripta (n=129) to supplement data on habitat use. Movements based on radiotelemetry and recaptures were summarized for each individual. Both species of turtles displayed dynamic annual activity patterns and used diverse habitats including those typically considered terrestrial. Although G. pseudogeographica and T. scripta spent a substantial portion of the year in the Missouri River (primarily in the cool months), newly created scour habitats also appeared to attract turtles during the cool season. However, in the warm months, habitat use became much more diverse, with turtles occupying all identified habitats including flooded agriculture and forest. Relative to their proportions, slough and scour habitats appeared to be highly favored while forests older than 4 years and agricultural habitats were proportionally less favored. We found few differences between species. However, males of both species were consistently more sedentary, used half as many habitats, and moved half as far from the river as did females, especially during May through July. Juveniles of both species were captured on average farther from the river than were adults, perhaps reflecting the close proximity of both nesting areas and shallow, productive habitats free of aquatic predators. We estimate a riparian zone of 449 m that encompasses 95% of the population movements away from the river and discuss the quality of habitats important to reproduction and survival of lentic and lotic floodplain turtles. These spatial and temporal movement patterns, in light of their potential adaptive costs and benefits to G. pseudogeographica and T. scripta, are critical to understanding the ecology of long-lived vertebrates that depend on contemporary large rivers.},

abstract = {To determine the capacity of sewage treatment work effluents to disrupt the endocrine system under semifield conditions, two amphibian species, Xenopus laevis and Rana temporaria, were exposed to the effluent of a regional sewage treatment plant in South Bavaria during larval development until completion of metamorphosis. Exposure was carried out in river water (W{\"{u}}rm) as a reference, and a 1:12-mixture sewage effluent representing the real situation on the spot, and in a higher concentration of sewage using a 1:2 mixture. An accidental impact of industrial wastewater into the reference and dilution medium, W{\"{u}}rm, which was caused by a spate in the respective area during the sensitive period of sex differentiation of amphibian larvae, is assumed to be responsible for the relatively high percentage of females observed by histological analysis in all treatment groups. All of these values were higher than those determined in controls exposed to artificial tap water in laboratory experiments conducted in a comparable study design. Sex ratios between species, revealed by the semifield study with decreasing portions of females from control to 1:12 to 1:2, were strongly correlated. Determination of biomarker-mRNA-levels in Xenopus liver using semiquantitative RT-PCR at the end of the experimental phase, when exposure regime has turned into the initially expected situation with the highest load of potential estrogens in the effluent, followed by 1:2 and 1:12 mixture, resulted in a significant increase of Vitellogenin-mRNA in female juveniles exposed to the highest portion of sewage, whereas expression of both androgen and estrogen receptor-mRNA showed no clear differences. The results concerning the induction of estrogenic biomarkers are in accordance with our findings for estrogen receptor binding of sample extracts from the W{\"{u}}rm and sewage taken in parallel at the end of the experiment, when sewage extracts possessed a much higher ability to displace [3H]estradiol from the estrogen receptor than the ones extracted from the mixtures. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Theory suggests that frequency-dependent resource competition will disproportionately impact the most common phenotypes in a population. The resulting disruptive selection forms the driving force behind evolutionary models of niche diversification, character release, ecological sexual dimorphism, resource polymorphism, and sympatric speciation. However, there is little empirical support for the idea that intraspecific competition generates disruptive selection. This paper presents a test of this theory, using natural populations of the three-spine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. Sticklebacks exhibit substantial individual specialization associated with phenotypic variation and so are likely to experience frequency-dependent competition and hence disruptive selection. Using body size and relative gonad mass as indirect measures of potential fecundity and hence fitness, I show that an important aspect of trophic morphology, gill raker length, is subject to disruptive selection in one of two natural lake populations. To test whether this apparent disruptive selection could have been caused by competition, I manipulated population densities in pairs of large enclosures in each of five lakes. In each lake I removed fish from one enclosure and added them to the other to create paired low- and high-population-density treatments with natural phenotype distributions. Again using indirect measures of fitness, disruptive selection was consistently stronger in high-density than low-density enclosures. These results support long-standing theoretical arguments that intraspecific competition drives disruptive selection and thus may be an important causal agent in the evolution of ecological variation.},

abstract = {Indirect trophic effects play important roles in ecosystem dynamics and can at times oppose and dominate the action of direct feeding linkages. Each predator directly exerts a negative effect upon its prey, but predators may also provide indirect benefits to their prey. In ecosystems, such benefits are effected via indirect trophic pathways that can provide a more than compensating positive influence. The ecosystem of the Big Cypress National Preserve (southwest Florida) appears to contain an unusually high number of such predators - most notably, the American alligator, Alligator mississippiensis. The trophic exchanges of carbon among the 68 principal taxa comprising the cypress wetland ecosystem have been quantified during both wet and dry seasons. The network analysis program IMPACTS identified predators that potentially have a positive influence on some of their prey. A total of 64 of these instances were recorded for the wet season and 44 for the dry. Taxa that, on balance, have positive effects upon their prey include fishes, turtles, snakes, birds, and, most significantly, alligators. The feeding habits of alligators benefit a conspicuous number (11) of their prey (invertebrates, frogs, mice, and rats). Further trophic analysis reveals that the predation by alligators on snakes and turtles accounts for most of the trophic benefits bestowed. The actions of alligators in modifying their physical environment has been cited elsewhere as contributing to the maintenance of biotic diversity. It appears that the trophic influence of this species adds further evidence to the important role it plays in the functional ecology of the cypress wetland.},

abstract = {Optimal foraging and habitat selection theories predict that heterogeneous environments should favour the coexistence of competitors, especially when the dominant competitor is a specialist and the sub-ordinate is a generalist. In this paper, we analysed differential habitat use as a potential mechanism for the coexistence of two competing riparian mammals, the specialist and dominant Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and the generalist and sub-ordinate American mink (Mustela vison). We tested three hypotheses: H1: mink coexist with otters for longer in areas with abundance of habitats hosting terrestrial prey because, by not relying on aquatic prey, mink can segregate from its competitor. H2: the characteristics of the habitat closer to the riverbank will affect the length of time the two species coexist, because mink are still tied to the water even in the presence of otters. H3: denser vegetative cover along the bank increases the duration of coexistence of mink and otters because it reduces the frequency of their encounters. The first hypothesis was supported by the data and we found that in areas where terrestrial prey was abundant mink coexisted for longer with otters. The second hypothesis was also supported by the data and the characteristics of the habitat closer to the riverbank were the most important in determining coexistence time. Finally, we did not find supporting evidence for the third hypothesis. This study provides strong evidence that habitat heterogeneity plays an important role in determining the likelihood of coexistence of American mink with Eurasian otters. This result is particularly important from a conservation standpoint. Mink are invasive and a threat to endangered species in parts of their range. The knowledge that mink have a higher chance to persist in the presence of otters when terrestrial prey is abundant should be used to target areas for preferential mink management.},

abstract = {Human-modified habitats rarely yield outcomes that are aligned with conservation ideals. Landscapes that are subdivided by roads are no exception, precipitating negative impacts on populations due to fragmentation, pollution, and road kill. Although many populations in human-modified habitats show evidence for local adaptation, rarely does environmental change yield outright benefits for populations of conservation interest. Contrary to expectations, we report surprising benefits experienced by amphibian populations breeding and dwelling in proximity to roads. We show that roadside populations of the wood frog, Rana sylvatica, exhibit better locomotor performance and higher measures of traits related to fitness compared with frogs from less disturbed environments located further away from roads. These results contrast previous evidence for maladaptation in roadside populations of wood frogs studied elsewhere. Our results indicate that altered habitats might not be unequivocally detrimental and at times might contribute to metapopulation success. While the frequency of such beneficial outcomes remains unknown, their occurrence underscores the complexity of inferring consequences of environmental change.},

A new distance measure, the reduced Mahalanobis distance, is explored in which the number of PCs retained is less than the full rank model. It is illustrated by both one-class and two-class classifiers. Linear discriminant analysis can be employed as a soft model, and principal component analysis using the pooled variance-covariance matrix is introduced as an intermediate view between conjoint and disjoint models allowing linear discriminant analysis to be used on these reduced rank models. By choosing the most discriminatory PCs, it can be shown that the reduced Mahalanobis distance has superior performance over the full rank model for discriminating via soft models.},

abstract = {One of the prevalent gradients in wetlands is the continuum of depth and frequency of flooding. While much emphasis has been placed on the importance of hydrology as a driving force for wetlands, few other perspectives have emerged to demonstrate unifying patterns and principles. In contrast to the wetness continuum, the functioning of wetlands can be separated into two broad categories: (1) landscape-based transitions that occur within a wetland or group of similar wetland types and (2) resource-based transitions that allow comparisons of the flow of water and processing of nutrients among very different wetland types. Landscape-based continua include the transition from upstream to downstream in riverine wetlands and between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems within a wetland. Along the upstream-downstream continuum, sources of flood-water delivery change dominance from ground-water discharge and overland runoff, as in low order streams, to dominance by overbank flooding, as in high order streams. With increasing size, properties related to the aquatic-to-terrestrial transition are replaced by properties related to wetland-atmospheric exchanges and by landscape maintenance, the latter not normally acknowledged as a wetland function. Resource-based continua include the extremes of (1) sources of water to wetlands (precipitation, overland flow, and ground water) and (2) the variation in inflows and outflows of nutrients and sediments. Emphasis on water source forces consideration of controls beyond the wetland's boundaries. A broader view of biogeochemical functioning is gained by categorizing wetlands into groups based on the exchange of nutrients and sediments among landscape units rather than on serving as a sink or source for a particular element. Based on this analysis, the less frequently flooded or saturated portions of wetlands are no less functionally active than wetter portions; the functions are simply different. Efforts to classify wetlands according to their hydroperiod do little to reveal their fundamental properties. {\textcopyright} 1993 Society of Wetland Scientists.},

However, how habitat specialisation is involved in such strategies is not fully understood, particularly in heterogeneous and disturbed environments. Here, we studied the trait associations between specialisation, dispersal ability, competitiveness, reproductive investment and survival rate in a spatially explicit metacommunity model under various disturbance rates. Though no unique trait values were associated with specialisation, relationships were uncovered depending on environmental factors. We found strong trait associations mainly for generalist species, while specialist species exhibited a larger range of trait combinations. Trait associations were driven first by the disturbance rate and second by species' dispersal ability and generation overlap. With disturbance, low dispersal ability was strongly selected against, for specialists as well as for generalists. Our results demonstrate that habitat specialisation is critical for the emergence of trait strategies in metacommunities and that disturbance in interaction with dispersal ability limits not only the range of trait values but also the type of possible trait associations.},

For example, the accumulation of nutrients, provision of shade, amelioration of disturbance, or protection from herbivores by some species can enhance the performance of neighbouring species. Thus the notion that the distributions and abundances of plant species are independent of other species may be inadequate as a theoretical underpinning for understanding species coexistence and diversity. But there have been no large-scale experiments designed to examine the generality of positive interactions in plant communities and their importance relative to competition. Here we show that the biomass, growth and reproduction of alpine plant species are higher when other plants are nearby. In an experiment conducted in subalpine and alpine plant communities with 115 species in 11 different mountain ranges, we find that competition generally, but not exclusively, dominates interactions at lower elevations where conditions are less physically stressful. In contrast, at high elevations where abiotic stress is high the interactions among plants are predominantly positive. Furthermore, across all high and low sites positive interactions are more important at sites with low temperatures in the early summer, but competition prevails at warmer sites.},

Because thyroid hormone is required for their normal development and reproduction, the potential impact of HPT-disrupting contaminants on natural teleost and amphibian populations raises special concern. There is laboratory evidence indicating that persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, pharmaceutical and personal care products, agricultural chemicals, and aerospace products may alter HPT activity, development, and reproduction in teleosts and amphibians. However, at present there is no evidence to clearly link contaminant-induced HPT alterations to impairments in teleost or amphibian population health in the field. Also, with the exception of perchlorate for which laboratory studies have shown a direct link between HPT disruption and adverse impacts on development and reproductive physiology, little is known about if or how other HPT-disrupting contaminants affect organismal performance. Future field studies should focus on establishing temporal associations between the presence of HPT-disrupting chemicals, the occurrence of HPT alterations, and adverse effects on development and reproduction in natural populations; as well as determining how complex mixtures of HPT contaminants affect organismal and population health. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of habitat selection is fundamental to the construction of proper conservation and management plans for many avian species. Habitat changes caused by human beings increase the landscape complexity and thus the complexity of data available for explaining species distribution. New techniques that assume no linearity and capable to extrapolate the response variables across landscapes are needed for dealing with difficult relationships between habitat variables and distribution data. We used a random forest algorithm to study breeding-site selection of herons and egrets in a human-influenced landscape by analyzing land use around their colonies. We analyzed the importance of each land-use variable for different scales and its relationship to the probability of colony presence. We found that there exist two main spatial scales on which herons and egrets select their colony sites: medium scale (4 km) and large scale (10-15 km). Colonies were attracted to areas with large amounts of evergreen forests at the medium scale, whereas avoidance of high-density urban areas was important at the large scale. Previous studies used attractive factors, mainly foraging areas, to explain bird-colony distributions, but our study is the first to show the major importance of repellent factors at large scales. We believe that the newest non-linear methods, such as random forests, are needed when modelling complex variable interactions when organisms are distributed in complex landscapes. These methods could help to improve the conservation plans of those species threatened by the advance of highly human-influenced landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Ecological Society of Japan.},

Landscape complexity can affect foraging scales, home ranges and movement, but its effect on habitat selection is not well documented. We aimed to examine differences in colony site selection of herons and egrets in different regions. We studied whether landscape complexities could affect their scale of selection and habitat preferences. We used colony distribution data and land-use maps for two neighboring regions, Ibaraki and Chiba prefectures in Japan, to create random forest models for analyzing habitat preferences and important scales of selection. We did cross-validation of the models, adjusted for its respective region's land-use maps with changing scales. The scales that best explained colony distribution were 1-, 4-, 10- and 15-km in the Ibaraki region, and 1- and 10-km in the Chiba region. Evergreen forest was the most important variable for Ibaraki at 4-km and for the Chiba at 1-km. The importance of other variables differed for other models. Cross-validation showed that herons and egrets had the same habitat preferences at a 4-km scale in Ibaraki and at a 1-km scale in Chiba. The scale of selection was reduced in Chiba, where the main foraging resources for herons and egrets was more complex. Differences in landscape complexities did not affect habitat preferences but resulted in differences in the scale of selection. Habitat selection models created at the landscape level can be useful to study behavioral aspects difficult to describe with direct observation in detail.},

abstract = {Marsh bird habitats are influenced by water levels which may pose challenges for interpreting bird-based indices of wetland health. We determined how much fluctuating water levels and associated changes in emergent vegetation influence the Index of Marsh Bird Community Integrity (IMBCI) using data collected in Great Lakes coastal wetlands by participants in Bird Studies Canada's Great Lakes Marsh Monitoring Program. IMBCI scores for 90 wetlands in Lake Erie and 131 wetlands in Lake Ontario decreased with decreasing water levels due to decreasing number of marsh-dependent species in Lake Erie and perhaps also in Lake Ontario. The average magnitude of the decrease in scores between extremely high and low water periods for wetlands with sufficient data was 15% in Lake Erie where water dropped 0.9. m on average (n=11 wetlands) and 18% in Lake Ontario where water dropped 0.5. m (n=7). Scores in Lake Erie increased with increasing Typha due to increasing numbers of marsh-dependent species and decreased with increasing Phragmites due to increasing numbers of generalist species. The opposite was observed in Lake Ontario, perhaps due to denser Typha and sparser Phragmites. Scores were explained by the naturally fluctuating water levels of Lake Erie, which favored Phragmites expansion and the regulated water levels of Lake Ontario which promoted Typha expansion. Scores were influenced by fluctuating water levels and associated changes in emergent vegetation. Inter-annual water level fluctuations should be considered when interpreting any indicator of wetland health that is based on marsh-dependent bird species. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Predators often employ a complex series of behaviors to overcome antipredator defenses and effectively capture prey. Although hunting behaviors can improve with age and experience, many precocial species are necessarily effective predators from birth. Additionally, many predators experience innate ontogenetic shifts in predatory strategies as they grow, allowing them to adapt to prey more appropriate for their increased size and energetic needs. Understanding how the relative roles of innate age-specific adaptation and learning have evolved requires information on how predation behavior develops in situ, in free-ranging predators. However, most of the research on the ontogeny of predation behavior is based on laboratory studies of captive animals, largely due to the difficulty of following newborn individuals in nature. Here, we take advantage of the unique tracks left by juveniles of a precocial viperid, the sidewinder rattlesnake (Crotalus cerastes), which we used to follow free-ranging snakes in the field. We recorded details of their ambush hunting behavior, and compared the behaviors of these juveniles to adult snakes that we monitored in the field via radio telemetry. Although juvenile and adult behaviors were similar in most respects, we did find that adults chose more effective ambush sites, which may be due to their increased experience. We also found that juveniles (but typically not adults) perform periodic tail undulations while in ambush, and that juveniles displayed slightly different activity cycles. Both of these latter differences are likely the result of age-specific adaptations for juveniles' greater reliance on lizards versus small mammals as prey. We also compared the general predatory behavior of sidewinders to that of other species in the genus Crotalus. These findings will provide important baseline field information for more detailed empirical research on the ontogeny of predation behavior in precocial vertebrates.},

We provided water to Black-throated Sparrows (Amphispiza bilineata) on breeding territories in the Mojave Desert of southern California to examine the effects of water availability on reproduction in desert birds, independent of the increase in food availability commonly associated with increased precipitation in arid ecosystems. In both years of the study (2000 and 2001), water-supplemented (treatment) pairs laid significantly larger clutches than did control pairs. In 2000, the drier of the two years, the mean clutch size of treatment pairs was almost 0.5 egg larger, or about 16% larger, than control pairs. Overall, the mean egg volume per nest in treatment and control pairs was not significantly different, and the mean proportion of eggs hatched was not significantly different at $\alpha$ = 0.05, but was nearly so. Daily nest survival probabilities were not greater in treatment nests than in control nests in 2000 or in 2001. Treatment nests did not produce a greater mean number of young surviving to day 8 than did control nests, although the trend is of greater means in treatment nests. The results of our study indicate that for species like the Black-throated Sparrow that are abundant in deserts, are successful in breeding there, and can survive without drinking water, water availability in arid environments can nevertheless impose limitations on reproduction.},

We compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to other common classification methods. We also observed that the variables that RF identified as most important for classifying invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the literature.},

abstract = {The role of deterministic and stochastic processes in community assembly is a key question in community ecology. We evaluated the effect of an abiotic filter (hydroperiod) on the partitioned diversity of three taxonomic groups (birds, vegetation, macroinvertebrates) from prairie pothole wetlands in Alberta, Canada, which naturally vary in water permanence. We observed that alpha and gamma diversity were higher in permanent than temporary wetlands (16–25% and 34–47% respectively, depending on the taxon). This suggests an influence of deterministic constraints on the number of species a wetland can support. Taxa which cannot persist in shallow, temporary wetlands are excluded by the deterministic constraints that a shortened hydroperiod imposes. In contrast, we observed that beta diversity was significantly higher (2–12%) in temporary wetlands than permanent ones, and temporary wetlands supported more unique combinations of community composition than permanent wetlands, despite having a smaller regional species pool. This observation contradicts prior mesocosm studies that found beta diversity mirrored the pattern in gamma diversity along an environmental filtering gradient. We conclude that deterministic processes are more influential in more stable permanent wetlands, whereas stochastic processes play a more important role in assembly in dynamic temporary wetlands that must disassemble and re-establish annually. Considering three distinct taxonomic groups differing in their relative mobility, our large-scale field study demonstrates that both stochastic and deterministic processes act together to influence the assembly of multiple communities and that the relative importance of the two processes varies consistently along a gradient of environmental filtering.},

abstract = {In desert species, seasonal peaks in animal activity often correspond with times of higher rainfall. However, the underlying reason for such seasonality can be hard to discern because the rainy season is often associated with shifts in temperature as well as water and food availability. We used a combination of the natural climate pattern of the Sonoran Desert and periodic water supplementation to determine the extent to which water intake influenced both the behavioral ecology and the physiological ecology of a long-lived desert lizard, the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) (Cope 1869). Water-supplemented lizards had lower plasma osmolality (i.e., were more hydrated) and maintained urinary bladder water reserves better during seasonal drought than did control lizards. During seasonal drought, water-supplemented lizards were surface active a significantly greater proportion of time than were controls. This increased surface activity can lead to greater food acquisition for supplemental Gila monsters because tail volume (an index of caudal lipid stores) was significantly greater in supplemented lizards compared with controls in one of the two study years. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The University of Chicago.

abstract = {It is well-known that vascular plants have species-specific effects on soil properties. However, little is known on how individual species forming biocrusts, communities dominated by lichens, mosses and cyanobacteria that are prevalent in many ecosystems world-wide, affect microbial communities and soil variables related to nutrient cycling. We evaluated the relationship of six biocrust-forming lichens (Buellia epipolia, Diploschistes diacapsis, Fulgensia subbracteata, Psora decipiens, Squamarina cartilaginea and Squamarina lentigera) with microbial abundance and multiple variables associated with soil nitrogen (N), carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) cycling and storage. We also evaluated whether the composition of lichen tissues (contents in C, N, P and polyphenols) is related to the C, N, P availability and microbial abundance in soils. Finally, we assessed what lichen species positively and negatively relate to soil fertility compared to bare ground areas without biocrusts. We found contrasted C, N, P availability and soil microbial abundance under the different biocrust-forming lichens. Interestingly, inorganic P and amino acids were the most important factors differentiating lichen microsites. These differences in nutrient availability seem to be related to the C, N and P composition of the lichen tissues. For example, soils under D. diacapsis and P. decipiens, which had the lowest and highest C, N and P contents in their tissues, respectively, had the lowest and highest nutrient availability, respectively. We also found contrasted soil microbes abundance under the different soil lichens. For instance, F. subbracteata and D. diacapsis were negatively related to the abundance of bacteria compared to bare ground areas. Our results support the idea that, as found with vascular plants, biocrust-forming lichens have species-specific effects on soil microbial communities and C, N and P cycling. Thus, continuing considering biocrusts as a unique entity will only add confusion to our knowledge of how they control nutrient availability and microbial abundance in the ecosystems where this key community is prevalent.},

These wetland sites differed in size, but were nearly identical in general locality, structure, hydrology, vege-tative composition, available resources, and biodiversity. Home ranges for male cottonmouths at the larger Cooper WMA (n = 16; 95% kernel density estimate (KDE) X = 54.69 ha AE 9.36; 100% minimum convex polygon (MCP) X = 22.9 ha AE 4.19) were significantly larger than those at the smaller Commerce WA (n = 10; 95% KDE X = 19.88 ha AE 4.71; 100% MCP X = 8.98 ha AE 2.27).

Average weekly distance traveled by males (X = 110.07 m AE 10.80) was significantly greater than that of females (X = 45.04 m AE 4.34), and male movement rates were bimodal in distribution with peaks of movement in the spring and fall. These peaks in movement rates coincided with the spring and fall migrations for mating, thermoregulation, partu-rition, and access to hibernacula and food resources. We found home ranges within these two-dimensional wetlands to be larger than those reported for linear or one-dimensional riparian sites. We discuss how wetland size and the size-dependent dispersion of potential resources within similar wetlands may influence movement patterns and home range sizes. Such information may serve to evaluate effective wetland size for the conservation and management of wetland species.},

Dependence on specific habitat characteristics for thermoregulation could make habitat selection by herpetofauna especially subtle. Enhancing knowledge of habitat selection by herpetofauna is critical for completely understanding natural histories and improving future habitat management strategies. We conducted a year-long telemetric habitat selection study on two Northern Cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus) populations in northeast Texas. We used a use–availability approach and investigated intersexual differences at three spatiotemporal scales: home range selection within the study site (home range selection); habitat selection within the home range (macrohabitat selection); and fine-scale local habitat selection (microhabitat selection). The home range selection of both males and females exhibited selection for edges and avoidance of pasture. Males only exhibited macrohabitat selection in the summer, when they selected edge and wetland. Females did not exhibit any macrohabitat selection. Males and females selected microhabitats with thick vegetation in the spring and summer. However, in the fall, male microhabitat selection was influenced by lower temperatures and female microhabitat use appeared to be driven by parturition. Although our study suffered from small female sample size and a short time frame, we provide insight into the complex habitat selection of Cottonmouths in northeast Texas.},

However, these new techniques have not yet been applied to amphibians and directly to conservation issues, i.e., to assess toxicological risks on threatened species. We used video-tracking analyses to test a quantitative effect of an environmental contaminant on the locomotion of amphibian tadpoles (Rana temporaria) by taking into account cumulative effects. Because recent research has demonstrated effects of de-icing salts on survival and community structure, we used sodium chloride in our experimental design (25 replicates, 4 concentrations, 4 times) to test for an effect at the scale of behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations. Analysis of 372 1-h video-tracks (5 samples/s) showed a complex action of salts on behavioral patterns with a dose and cumulative response over time. Although no effects were found on mortality or growth, the highest salt concentrations reduced the speed and movement of tadpoles in comparison with control treatments. The reduced locomotor performance could have detrimental consequences in terms of tadpoles' responses to competition and predation and may be an indicator of the low concentration effect of the contaminant. On one hand, this study demonstrates the usefulness of examining behavior to address conservation issues and understand the complex action of environmental factors and, more particularly, pollutants on organisms. On the other hand, our results highlight the need of new computerized techniques to quantitatively analyze these patterns. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper, we tested whether the spatial distribution of a given species in more or less fragmented and disturbed landscapes depends on the species habitat specialization. We studied 891 spatial replicates from the French Breeding Bird Survey (FBBS) monitored at least two years during 2001-2005, and two independent landscape databases measuring respectively landscape fragmentation and recent landscape disturbance on each FBBS replicate. We used a continuous habitat specialization index for the 105 most common bird species monitored by the FBBS. We further modelled the spatial variation in abundance of each species according to fragmentation and disturbance across FBBS replicates, accounting for habitat differences and spatial trends. We then tested whether more or less specialized species responded to landscape fragmentation and disturbance. We found that the more specialist a species, the more negative its spatial response to landscape fragmentation and disturbance. Although there was a very high variation around these tendencies indicating that there are many other drivers of species distribution, our results suggest that measuring specialization may be helpful in predicting which species are likely to thrive in human degraded landscapes. We also emphasize the need to consider both positive and negative species responses when assessing consequences of habitat change in communities.},

abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the 'folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| >0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Aim We derived phylogenies, phylogeographies, and population demographies for two North American pitvipers, Agkistrodon contortrix (Linnaeus, 1766) and A. piscivorus (Lac{\'{e}}p{\`{e}}de, 1789) (Viperidae: Crotalinae), as a mechanism to evaluate the impact of rapid climatic change on these taxa. Location Midwestern and eastern North America. Methods We reconstructed maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) relationships based on 846 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) ATPase 8 and ATPase 6 genes sequenced over 178 individuals. We quantified range expansions, demographic histories, divergence dates and potential size differences among clades since their last period of rapid expansion. We used the Shimodaira–Hasegawa (SH) test to compare our ML tree against three biogeographical hypotheses. Results A significant SH test supported diversification of A. contortrix from northeastern Mexico into midwestern–eastern North America, where its trajectory was sundered by two vicariant events. The first (c. 5.1 Ma) segregated clades at 3.1% sequence divergence (SD) along a continental east–west moisture gradient. The second (c. 1.4 Ma) segregated clades at 2.4% SD along the Mississippi River, coincident with the formation of the modern Ohio River as a major meltwater tributary. A single glacial refugium was detected within the Apalachicola region of southeastern North America. Significant support was also found for a hypothesis of trans-Gulf rafting by the common ancestor of A. piscivorus from eastern Mexico (possibly the Yucatan Peninsula) to northern Florida. There, a Mid–Late Pliocene marine transgression separated it at 4.8% SD from mainland North America. Significant range expansions followed compressive glacial effects in three (of four) A. contortrix clades and in two (of three) A. piscivorus clades, with the Florida A. piscivorus clade exhibiting significant distributional stasis. Main conclusions Pliocene glaciations, rapidly developing western aridity, and Pleistocene glacial meltwaters seemingly led to the diversification of A. contortrix and A. piscivorus in North America. Both species were pushed southwards by Pleistocene climate change, with subsequent northward expansions uninhibited topographically. The subspecific taxonomy used for A. contortrix and A. piscivorus today, however, appear non-representative. The monophyletic Florida subspecies of A. piscivorus may be a distinct species (at 4.8% SD), whereas two western subspecies of A. contortrix also appear to constitute a single distinct species, pending additional analyses. We conclude that both species of Agkistrodon can be used as suitable ectothermic models to gauge impacts of future climate change.},

abstract = {The 2001 U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC) held that isolated intrastate non-navigable waters could not be protected under the Clean Water Act (CWA) based on the presence of migratory birds. SWANCC represented a major reinterpretation of the CWA by re-emphasizing the importance of navigability in the definition of "waters of the United States" protected by the statute. The decision also implied that isolated waters might be "waters of the United States" where they had a "significant nexus" to navigable waters. Understanding the significance of SWANCC requires a historical look at the geographic scope of federal laws and regulations protecting surface waters. The concept of navigability had been prominent in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, but the principal implementation focus for the CWA after its enactment in 1972 and prior to SWANCC had been on the hydrologic cycle and the relevance of links to interstate commerce for determining what waters were protected under the CWA. In upcoming years and months, the geographic jurisdiction of the CWA will continue to be debated in the courts, within Federal agencies, and by the public. Aquatic resource science will play a key role in helping ensure that the CWA is implemented in a scientifically defensible manner, consistent with SWANCC. One area in need of particular emphasis is additional research on the ways in which isolated waters help ensure the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of navigable waters and their tributaries. It is this question-the "significant nexus" between an intrastate non-navigable isolated water and the rest of the aquatic ecosystem-that will likely determine whether the water will be protected by the CWA.},

abstract = {Competition for prey is thought to be important in structuring snake assemblages. However, due in part to the secretive behavior and low detectability of many snake species, this generalization is based on a limited number of studies, most of which focus on a single study site. We examined differences in diet composition, trophic niche overlap, site occupancy and detectability of five sympatric aquatic snake species between two different habitat types in the Southeastern US, replicated at the landscape scale: permanent wetlands with fishes (n = 13) and isolated, often ephemeral wetlands without fishes (n = 10). We collected >3700 prey items from snakes and compared diet composition among snake species to examine niche breadth and overlap, correcting for relative availability of prey captured independently in the same wetlands. We evaluated evidence for competitive exclusion by estimating the probability of co-occupancy for pairs of snake species in each habitat type using occupancy modeling. In wetlands with fishes, niche overlap was low, suggesting resource partitioning. Conversely, in wetlands without fishes, niche overlap was high, with most species feeding on larval or paedomorphic ambystomatid salamanders, but competitive exclusion did not occur. We suggest that high co-occupancy of aquatic snakes in wetlands without fishes despite the apparent lack of resource partitioning is due to a combination of seasonally high abundance of high quality amphibian prey, unique aspects of predator physiology and stochastic abiotic processes that prevent these systems from reaching equilibrium. Our results demonstrate that snake diets can be highly context (e.g. habitat)-specific. Studies should consider other factors in addition to competition for prey when attempting to understand snake population and community dynamics.},

To date, the majority of studies examining AM fungal community diversity have focused on single habitats with similar environmental conditions, with relatively few studies having assessed the diversity of AM fungi over large-scale environmental gradients. In this study, we characterized AM fungal communities in the soil along a high-elevation gradient in the North American Rocky Mountains. We focused on phylogenetic patterns of AM fungal communities to gain insight into how AM fungal communities are naturally assembled. We found that alpine AM fungal communities had lower phylogenetic diversity relative to lower elevation communities, as well as being more heterogeneous in composition than either treeline or subalpine communities. AM fungal communities were phylogenetically clustered at all elevations sampled, suggesting that environmental filtering, either selection by host plants or fungal niches, is the primary ecological process structuring communities along the gradient.},

abstract = {Many studies have assessed the impact of different pollutants on amphibians across a variety of experimental venues (laboratory, mesocosm, and enclosure conditions). Past reviews, using vote-counting methods, have described pollution as one of the major threats faced by amphibians. However, vote-counting methods lack strong statistical power, do not permit one to determine the magnitudes of effects, and do not compare responses among predefined groups. To address these challenges, we conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured the effects of different chemical pollutants (nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds, pesticides, road deicers, heavymetals, and other wastewater contaminants) at environmentally relevant concentrations on amphibian survival, mass, time to hatching, time to metamorphosis, and frequency of abnormalities. The overall effect size of pollutant exposure was a medium decrease in amphibian survival and mass and a large increase in abnormality frequency. This translates to a 14.3% decrease in survival, a 7.5% decrease in mass, and a 535% increase in abnormality frequency across all studies. In contrast, we found no overall effect of pollutants on time to hatching and time to metamorphosis.We also found that effect sizes differed among experimental venues and among types of pollutants, but we only detected weak differences among amphibian families. These results suggest that variation in sensitivity to contaminants is generally independent of phylogeny. Some publication bias (i.e., selective reporting) was detected, but only for mass and the interaction effect size among stressors. We conclude that the overall impact of pollution on amphibians is moderately to largely negative. This implies that pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations pose an important threat to amphibians and may play a role in their present global decline.{\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.},

This can affect interspecies associations for regularly interacting sympatric species, like bottlenose and spotted dolphins in the Bahamas (observed since 1985 and interspecies associations analyzed since 1993). After two hurricanes in 2004 each species lost roughly 30% of their respective communities resulting in differing social structure and behavioral changes. During mixed species encounters (MSE) group sizes for spotted dolphins (x- = 14.1 ± 9.2) were significantly larger than bottlenose dolphins (x- = 6.0 ± 7.3; F = 11.74, df = 1, P < 0.001), however, t-tests revealed no differences between aggressive vs. affiliative encounters. Sexual/aggressive behavior regularly seen previously was not observed posthurricanes and aggressive encounters were greatly reduced. Generally results were similar to prehurricane data including high resightings of spotted dolphins with male alliances prevalent (including new juvenile alliances seen only posthurricane), and individualized bottlenose participation with few male alliances. However temporal associations varied compared to prehurricane. Interspecies association and behavior patterns were altered and likely affected by the changes in intraspecies association patterns following the hurricanes. However both species still participated in MSE, suggesting this is an important component of their ability to coexist as sympatric species.},

In north-west Africa, Emys orbicularis and Natrix astreptophora are stenotopic species having fragmented distributions, while Mauremys leprosa and Natrix maura occur throughout the region (eurytopic species). We investigated the factors underlying these distributional patterns and tested the hypothesis that species sharing similar resources tend to be spatially segregated. We characterized the niches of the species based on climatic, topographic, soil texture, landscape and hydrological predictors. The relationship between the presence of a species and the environmental gradient was assessed using distance-based linear models, and habitat suitability was modelled using Random Forests. Our results indicated that both E. orbicularis and N. astreptophora occupy extreme positions within the environmental gradient. Climate and landscape were the major factors influencing the relative occurrences of the stenotopic and eurytopic species. However, these semi-aquatic reptiles are likely to be subject to similar ecological constraints, as their occurrence was positively associated with greater complexity of the drainage system. Thus, there was a high degree of niche overlap between the stenotopic and eurytopic species at large spatial scales.},

abstract = {Although habitat selection has been studied in a variety of snake taxa, little is known about habitat selection in aquatic snake species. Additionally, due to their small size and secretive nature, juvenile snakes are seldom included in habitat selection studies. The Eastern cottonmouth Agkistrodon piscivorus is a semi-aquatic pit viper known to use ambush, sit-and-wait foraging strategies. Ambush hunters are likely to select habitats that increase opportunity for successful prey capture while minimizing predation risk and maintaining appropriate thermal and hydric conditions. We characterized the foraging strategy and microhabitat use of cottonmouths at Ellenton Bay, an isolated Carolina bay freshwater wetland on the Savannah River Site in SC, USA. We measured habitat characteristics of 55 ambush sites used by 51 individual cottonmouths located during nighttime visual surveys, as well as 225 randomly selected sites within our search area. Cottonmouths exhibited an ontogenetic shift in foraging strategy with juveniles using predominately ambush foraging around the edge of the wetland while adults were most often encountered actively moving within the wetland. Principal components analysis revealed that juveniles selected foraging microhabitats that were different from random and consisted of mud substrate with sparse vegetation, whereas adults occupied a greater variety of microhabitats that did not differ from random. Concomitantly, free-ranging cottonmouths exhibited ontogenetic shifts in diet: juveniles consumed mostly salamanders, while adults ate a greater variety of prey including other snakes and birds. Our results highlight the importance of understanding how ontogenetic changes in coloration, diet and predation risk influence foraging strategy and microhabitat selection in snakes. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.},
annote = {Observation: Snake species show ontogenetic shifts in diet and foraging strategy, changes in the habitats necessary to accommodate these behaviors may be expected.
Aim: To conduct a comprehensive habitat selection study of the eastern cottonmouth.
Characterized foraging strategies used by cottonmouths within an isolated wetland and the microhabitats that cottonmouths used as foraging sites in comparison with available habitat.
Question: 
1. Do cottonmouths select microhabitat-specific abush sites or are they foraging at random?
2. Is there an ontogenetic shift in foraging strategy that could in turn influence habitat choice?
3. What factors are involved in this shift in foraging strategy?

Results:
* Significant difference between foraging strategies used by adults and juveniles, with juveniles using tightly coiled ambush postures more frequently than adults.
*Tightly coiled snakes were generally found farther from open water, in open mucky microhabitats with fewer lilies and grasses.
* Large snakes were found closer to the center of the wetland than smaller snakes.

Conclusion: 
Juvenile cottonmouths were found to hunt using tightly coiled postures along the edge of the wetland in specific microhabitats. Adults were in a variety of microhabitats, especially deep water.

Larger snakes forage widley, but often in the more aquatic microhabitats. Juveniles select higher propotions of land, presumably to allow tight coiling and ambush hunting in habitats where smaller prey items are abundant.

***Cottonmouths may be ideal study organisms for investigations forcusing on complex foraging behaviors in a variety of habitats},

abstract = {Breeding success of frogs depends, among other factors, on male and female habitat choices, which may be based in part on environmental features that aid offspring survivorship and development. Frogs can respond to habitat features in varied scales, including types of bodies of water and microhabitats within them, and the correspondence between male and female choices may contribute to a successful reproduction. We compared habitat and microhabitat choices by males and females of a Scinax species from the catharinae clade, focusing on microhabitat selection by both sexes, including variation between dry and wet seasons. We also compared the distribution of males and females across a stream size gradient and related their abundance with numbers of tadpoles in each stream to assess successful breeding. We found males and females to be similar in microhabitat preferences, but their abundances did not correlate across streams. Male abundance, however, correlated with number of tadpoles, indicating that number of females may have been underestimated due to their shorter permanence at breeding sites or lower detection probability. Competition and predation did not seem to influence distribution of Scinax gr. catharinae among streams. Male and female Scinax gr. catharinae seem to show highly coordinated responses when selecting breeding habitats and microhabitats, apparently resulting in high breeding success at the study site. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The Herpetologists' League, Inc.},

abstract = {Landscape ecology often adopts a patch mosaic model of ecological patterns. However, many ecological attributes are inherently continuous and classification of species composition into vegetation communities and discrete patches provides an overly simplistic view of the landscape. If one adopts a niche-based, individualistic concept of biotic communities then it may often be more appropriate to represent vegetation patterns as continuous measures of site suitability or probability of occupancy, rather than the traditional abstraction into categorical community types represented in a mosaic of discrete patches. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the high effectiveness of species-level, pixel scale prediction of species occupancy as a continuous landscape variable, as an alternative to traditional classified community type vegetation maps. We use a Random Forests ensemble learning approach to predict site-level probability of occurrence for four conifer species based on climatic, topographic and spectral predictor variables across a 3,883 km2 landscape in northern Idaho, USA. Our method uses a new permutated sample-downscaling approach to equalize sample sizes in the presence and absence classes, a model selection method to optimize parsimony, and independent validation using prediction to 10% bootstrap data withhold. The models exhibited very high accuracy, with AUC and kappa values over 0.86 and 0.95, respectively, for all four species. The spatial predictions produced by the models will be of great use to managers and scientists, as they provide vastly more accurate spatial depiction of vegetation structure across this landscape than has previously been provided by traditional categorical classified community type maps. {\textcopyright} 2009 US Government.},

abstract = {Bird species richness and individual species densities were measured in wetland complexes in 1998. These values were then related to habitat variables within the complexes and to area of wetland habitat in the surrounding landscape. The percentage of wetland area within a complex that was covered with emergent vegetation and the total area of wetland habitat in the 3 km surrounding each complex were significant predictors of species richness. A perimeter-to-area ratio was the most frequently selected variable for inclusion in species-density models, being selected for 8 of 15 models. Five species' densities were related to the percentage of the wetland area that was covered by emergent vegetation, and 4 densities were related to the area covered by weak-stemmed wet-meadow vegetation. Densities of 5 species, as well as the overall species richness, were associated with a measure of the amount of wetland habitat within a 3-km buffer surrounding the wetland complexes. This indicates that the presence and abundance of some wetland bird species may be influenced by the amount of wetland habitat nearby. Thus, programs that encourage restoration of tracts of land that contain multiple wetland basins should be emphasized to maximize benefits to the wetland bird community. Key},

Six species of trematodes, 4 cestodes, 9 nematodes, and 2 acanthocephalans were recovered from these snakes. At the Head of Island locality, Dasymetra villicaeca and Proteocephalus variabilis had the highest prevalence and abundance in Nerodia cyclopion; D. villicaeca, Styphlodora magna, and Terranova caballeroi displayed the broadest host specificity, infecting all snakes from Head of Island. Species richness and mean number of individuals were highest in N. cyclopion and A. piscivorus, but diversity was highest in N. fasciata. Proteocephalus perspicua and P. variabilis were most prevalent and abundant in N. cyclopion at the Spanish Lake locality; Ochetosoma aniarum and Kalicephalus rectiphilus displayed broadest host specificity, infecting all snakes from Spanish Lake. Species richness and mean number of individuals were highest in N. cyclopion, while diversity was highest in A. piscivorus. In general, higher prevalence, abundance, species richness, and mean number of individuals occurred in snakes from Head of Island. The helminth fauna of Nerodia spp. were most similar, reflecting close phylogenetic affinities and broad overlap in diet. In contrast, the helminth fauna of the viperid, A. piscivorus, contained 5 helminths that were restricted to this snake. We propose that host diet, habitat differences, and phylogeny are the most important determinants of the helminth fauna of aquatic snakes.

We aimed to assess whether palmitoleate relates to cardiometabolic risk.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: In this cross-sectional study we included 358 individuals aged 30-65-years at high cardiovascular risk. We tested the association of palmitoleate (determined by gas chromatography) with metabolic syndrome (MS) and its components (defined by ATPIII criteria), fatty liver index (a surrogate of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]), and subclinical atherosclerosis (determined as ultrasound-measured carotid intima-media thickness and arterial stiffness). Palmitoleate concentration was higher in women compared with men (median ± range interquartile, 1.36 ± 0.96 vs. 0.97 ± 0.77 $\mu$mol/L respectively, P < 0.001). In both genders palmitoleate concentration was associated with a higher prevalence of MS: men, odds ratio [OR: 1.12 (95%CI: 1.03; 1.23, P = 0.010)]; women [OR: 1.07 (95%CI: 1.03; 1.13, P = 0.005)], and all of its components except low HDL-cholesterol and hypertriglyceridemia. Palmitoleate was also associated with increased risk of NAFLD in both men [OR: 1.12 (95%CI: 1.03; 1.29, P = 0.031)] and women [OR: 1.11 (95%CI: 1.05; 1.19, P = 0.001)].

Roadkills are a premier mortality source, yet except for local spots, rates rarely limit population size. Road avoidance, especially due to traffic noise, has a greater ecological impact. The still-more-important barrier effect subdivides populations, with demographic and probably genetic consequences. Road networks crossing landscapes cause local hydrologic and erosion effects, whereas stream networks and distant valleys receive major peak-flow and sediment impacts. Chemical effects mainly occur near roads. Road networks interrupt horizontal ecological flows, alter landscape spatial pattern, and therefore inhibit important interior species. Thus, road density and network structure are informative landscape ecology assays. Australia has huge road-reserve networks of native vegetation, whereas the Dutch have tunnels and overpasses perforating road barriers to enhance ecological flows. Based on road-effect zones, an estimated 15-20% of the United States is ecologically impacted by roads.},

abstract = {In Crystal Lake, British Columbia, small fry (≤15 mm SL) of the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are concentrated in vegetation while larger fry are not. Because fry in all size classes feed primarily on zooplankton, even when in vegetation, we hypothesized that size-limited predation was responsible for the observed shift in habitat use with size. The major predators on fry in Crystal Lake are adult threespine stickleback, the water scorpion, Ranatra sp. (Hemiptera: Nepidae), backswimmers, Notonecta spp. (Hemiptera: Notonectidae), and dragonfly naiads of the genus Aeshna (Odonata: Aeschnidae). On the basis of distribution and hunting behavior we excluded the insects Ranatra sp., and Notonecta sp. as causal agents for this shift in resource by fry in water >0.25 m deep. Ranatra was found almost exclusively near the shoreline in water <0.25 m deep, and both insects hunted primarily as ambush predators within vegetation. Such predators seemed more likely to drive vulnerable fry from vegetation than to restrict them to it. In contrast, Aeshna naiads and adult stickleback frequently hunted outside of vegetation. In prey preference experiments the naiads did not show the decline in predation efficiency on fry >15 mm SL that would be expected if size-limited predation by this insect was responsible for the observed shift in resource use by fry. Adult stickleback only fed on fry <15 mm SL, and in an experimental situation, consumed fry at a rate 10 times greater than that exhibited by any of the insects. Predation experiments demonstrated that small fry (11-15 mm) spent more time in vegetation in the presence of adult conspecifics than they did in control pools, as would be expected if size-limited cannibalism caused small, vulnerable fry to be restricted to vegetation. Fry >15 mm SL were found outside of vegetation more often than in control treatments. The probable cause of this result is that adults become aggressive toward fry at this size, and often could be seen chasing large fry from vegetation during the experiments. Dragonfly naiads (Aeshna spp.) spent most of their time in vegetation in the experimental pools. Both size classes of fry spent less time in vegetation in the presence of dragonfly naiads than they did in control treatments, an apparent reflection of their similar vulnerabilities to these naiads. The presence of vegetation in pools reduced predation rates by adult stickleback on small fry. Because the experiments presented here indicate that fry are capable of rapidly assessing predation risk and of altering their behavior adaptively, we conclude that small fry occupy vegetation as a refuge from cannibalism. Once fry have reached the size-threshold at which they are no longer vulnerable to adult conspecifics they are able to forage farther from vegetation thereby reducing risk of predation by insects in vegetation and possibly acquiring more abundant food resources. {\textcopyright} 1988 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {With urban, agricultural, and industrial needs growing throughout the past decades, wetland ecosystems have experienced profound changes. Most critically, the biodiversity of wetlands is intimately linked to its hydrologic dynamics, which in turn are being drastically altered by ongoing climate changes. Hydroperiod regimes, e.g., percentage of time a site is inundated, exert critical control in the creation of niches for different plant species in wetlands. However, the spatial signatures of the organization of plant species in wetlands and how the different drivers interact to yield such signatures are unknown. Focusing on Everglades National Park (ENP) in Florida, we show here that cluster sizes of each species follow a power law probability distribution and that such clusters have well-defined fractal characteristics. Moreover, we individuate and model those signatures via the interplay between global forcings arising from the hydroperiod regime and local controls exerted by neighboring vegetation. With power law clustering often associated with systems near critical transitions, our findings are highly relevant for the management of wetland ecosystems. In addition, our results show that changes in climate and land management have a quantifiable predictable impact on the type of vegetation and its spatial organization in wetlands.},

abstract = {Trait-based approaches can reveal the mechanisms through which disturbances or stress impact communities, allowing comparisons of the role of different mechanisms in shaping communities among taxonomic groups. Such information can lead to higher comparability, transferability and predictability of the outcome of restoration projects. However, multitaxa trait-based approaches were rarely used in the context of ecosystem restoration. We investigated the responses to environmental gradients of seven taxa (vascular plants, staphylinid and carabid beetles, spiders, isopods, diplopods and earthworms) in a restored floodplain using a species traits approach. We assessed the impact of flood disturbances and soil hydric stress on the functional diversity (FD) and community-weighted mean (CWM) response of traits for each taxon. Ordination of hydrological variables revealed two main gradients. The first was related to the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood disturbances and the second to the average changes in soil hydric conditions. The analysis of CWM revealed that larger, poorly mobile species with narrow ecological tolerances were filtered by regular floods and/or changes in soil hydric conditions. Functional diversity patterns differed between the two gradients: decreasing with increasing flood disturbance, but increasing along the soil hydric stress gradient. This suggests that the mechanisms shaping community composition differ between the two gradients with environmental filtering being dominant with increasing flood disturbances and competition decreasing with more soil hydric stress. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the impact of restored flood disturbances and soil hydric stress on plant and invertebrate functional diversity and community-weighted mean can be positive, negative or more complex depending on the taxonomic group and environmental gradient considered. The patterns can to some extent be explained by the specific characteristics of each group. Larger, poorly mobile species with narrow ecological tolerances were particularly vulnerable to changes in disturbance and stress regime following floodplain restoration. These species may therefore be lost in the initial phases of restoration projects, but other more characteristic species of dynamic floodplains will be favoured. Understanding the consequences of these contrasted responses for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem functioning constitutes the next challenge for ecosystem restoration.

Analysis of variable importance indicated that the amount of forests and forest edge, hydrology, and human population density were the most important factors determining presence or absence of panthers. Sensitivity analysis showed that the presence of human populations, roads, and agriculture (other than pasture) had strong negative effects on the probability of panther presence. Forest cover and forest edge had strong positive effects. The median model-predicted probability of presence for panther home ranges was 0.81 (0.82 for females and 0.74 for males). The model identified 5579 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable breeding habitat remaining in southern Florida; 1399 km<sup>2</sup> (25%) of this habitat is in non-protected private ownership. Because there is less panther habitat remaining than previously thought, we recommend that all remaining breeding habitat in south Florida should be maintained, and the current panther range should be expanded into south-central Florida. This model should be useful for evaluating the impacts of future development projects, in prioritizing areas for panther conservation, and in evaluating the potential impacts of sea-level rise and changes in hydrology.},

The majority of research has centered around aluminum although some information is available regarding copper, cadmium, iron, zinc and lead. The major habitat types in which amphibians live and breed are listed and the mechanisms by which these habitats may become acidified and contaminated with metals are discussed. Three lines of investigation into acid and metal toxicity are reviewed in detail: (1) field surveys of water chemistry, (2) laboratory toxicity tests, (3) field studies which include in situ toxicity tests, and surveys of amphibian distribution and survival relative to water chemistry. As a result of recent information from each of these three lines of research, it appears that aluminum toxicity is an extremely complex phenomenon which is influenced by the hardness, pH, DOC of the water, and the developmental stage and species of amphibian. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

Data on the habitat selection of Prairie Rattlesnakes at northern range limits are essential to inform management strategies and implement recovery plans in Canada and other northern regions. We used radio-telemetry and generalized linear mixed models to create resource selection functions for Prairie Rattlesnakes (N = 23) in and around Grasslands National Park, Saskatchewan, Canada. Eight habitat variables were compared between used and available sites to quantify microhabitat selection. We found that Prairie Rattlesnakes select for specific sites (i.e., within 1 m) with shrub cover and burrows and avoid bare ground. Shrub cover was two-times higher at used sites compared to available ones, while bare ground showed the opposite trend. In addition, two-thirds of all snake location points were within 1 m of a burrow, which suggests that retreat sites are important. None...},

abstract = {The role of habitat disturbance on biodiversity is central as it promotes changes in ecological systems. That said, still little is known about the functional consequences of such changes. Functional diversity can be used to revealing more mechanistically the disturbance effects on communities by considering the richness and the distribution of traits among the species. Here we analyzed the response of functional and species diversity of ground beetles to flood disturbance to better understand the functioning of alluvial invertebrate communities. Ground beetles were sampled in periodically flooded grasslands along the Elbe River in Germany. We used generalized linear mixed effects models to unveil the relationships between flood disturbance, species and functional diversity, respectively. We measured different components of functional diversity (functional richness, evenness, dispersion, and divergence) and analyzed species diversity by means of rarefied species richness, abundances, evenness and Simpson's diversity. We found contrasting relationships in that most species diversity measures peaked at highest disturbance levels, while most functional diversity measures decreased with increasing disturbance intensities. Inversed relationships between species and functional diversity are rarely observed, as most studies report on positive correlations. We explain increasing species diversity with a higher amount of resources available in highly disturbed sites. Decreasing functional diversity is best explained through the convergence of species traits by flood disturbance and uneven resource exploitation in highly disturbed plots (low functional evenness), suggesting strong impacts from functionally different generalist species in floodchannels. We show that the amount of resources available, and how these resources are exploited, play major roles in the functioning of floodplain ground beetle communities. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

We conducted a year-long population-level analysis of cottonmouth Agkistrodon piscivorus migration patterns by monitoring snakes entering and leaving a Carolina bay wetland that was encircled by a continuous terrestrial drift fence. Cottonmouths used the wetland during the active season and left the bay in the fall to overwinter in other habitats. Adults and juveniles did not differ in time of arrival at the bay but juveniles left the bay earlier than adults. Spatially, captures of adult cottonmouths entering and leaving the bay were distributed non-randomly, with capture peaks corresponding to the directions to the nearest permanent aquatic habitats. Juveniles' immigration patterns in the spring were biased in the same directions as those of the adults, but they left non-directionally in the fall. This suggests that neonates do not rely on adult scent trailing to locate hibernacula, and that in a region with moderate winter temperatures, suitable overwintering sites may not be a limited resource. Additionally, our study demonstrates that cottonmouths make extensive use of upland habitats and underscores the importance of both critical upland habitat and forested corridors between wetlands and hibernacula for the conservation of wetlands herpetofauna.},

abstract = {Few studies of venomous snakes have addressed how anti-predator behavior may be affected by experience with a potential predator. Because defensive strikes may be costly to snakes, individuals with the ability to learn to discriminate among potentially harmful and non-harmful predatory stimuli should be favored by natural selection. In large venomous snakes, adults are capable of successfully defending themselves against most potential predators, whereas neonates suffer higher predator-induced mortality and are faced with a large diversity of predators. Consequently, we hypothesized that the relative costs of habituation to potential predatory stimuli should vary ontogenetically. This hypothesis predicts that adults should habituate rapidly to non-harmful predatory stimuli, whereas neonates should consistently employ active defensive displays (e.g. striking) because they are at higher risk. To test this prediction, we examined daily changes in the defensive behavior of adult and neonate cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorus) towards a standardized non-harmful predatory stimulus. As predicted, adults and neonates differed in their tendencies to habituate: adults decreased defensiveness over days while neonates did not. Adults showed habituation of striking components but not of warning displays. Our results support the hypothesis that there may be ontogenetic differences in predator perception. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Verlag.},

The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) is a very diverse region due to geological history, geographic position, and climate. It is also one of the most disturbed regions in Mexico. Reptiles are particularly sensitive to environmental changes due to their low dispersal capacity and thermal ecology. In this study, we define the important environmental variables (considering climate, topography, and land use) and potential distribution (present and future) of the five <italic>Thamnophis</italic> species present in TMVB. To do so, we used the maximum entropy modeling software (MAXENT). First, we modeled to select the most important variables to explain the distribution of each species, then we modeled again using only the most important variables and projected these models to the future considering a middle-moderate climate change scenario (rcp45), and land use and vegetation variables for the year 2050 (generated according to land use changes that occurred between years 2002 and 2011). Arid vegetation had an important negative effect on habitat suitability for all species, and minimum temperature of the coldest month was important for four of the five species. <italic>Thamnophis cyrtopsis</italic> was the species with the lowest tolerance to minimum temperatures. The maximum temperature of the warmest month was important for <italic>T. scalaris</italic> and <italic>T. cyrtopsis</italic> .

abstract = {Viperid snakes strike, envenomate, and release mammalian prey to prevent being harmed by the prey; snakes must then track prey in the process of strike-induced chemosensory searching. Because rattlesnakes prefer to track and consume envenomated prey, it would seem that the scent of envenomated tissue is key to the tracking process. After striking rodents, rattlesnakes also retain a specific chemical search image of prey items. I examined this behavioral pattern in copperheads (Agkistrodon contortrix) from three US populations with documented dietary biases toward mammals (Kansas), lepidopteran larvae (Texas), and amphibians (Louisiana), respectively. Experiments were conducted to assess whether copperheads form a specific search image of non-envenomated mouse, hornworm, and frog prey items. Additional experiments tested the relative importance of envenomated tissue to prey scent. Results indicate that copperheads do not form a specific search image of prey items. Preference for non-envenomated prey items is in the order mouse > hornworm > frog for all three populations; therefore, the innate behavioral preference for types of prey does not match the dietary biases noted in the literature. Envenomated mice and hornworms were preferred to all nonenvenomated prey items, but most trials involving envenomated frogs did not suggest envenomated prey preference. Overall, these results suggest that when the snakes search for prey, envenomated tissue stimuli are more important to snakes than scents arising from the prey itself. Searching and consumption behaviors seem to be independent, suggesting that strike-induced chemosensory searching and consumption are more complicated behavioral processes than previously recognized.},

T. sirtalis and T. ordinoides, which are more widely distributed on Vancouver Island than is T. elegans, were not shown to modify their diets in the absence of T. elegans, but this lack of niche shift may be due to variations in prey availability. Neither innate differences in food preferences among the species nor interspecific competition for food explained the observed differences in diet among the 3 spp. Certain types of prey appear more likely than others to turn up in large numbers in stomach samples, and this may be due to variations in ease of capture and (or) abundance.

We explored the hypothesis that mineral N can cause both lethal and sublethal toxic effects in amphibian embryos and larvae in a manipulative field experiment. We sampled 12 ponds, fertilizing half with ammonium nitrate fertilizer early in the spring, and measured hatching, survival, development, growth, and the incidence of deformities in native populations of wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and eastern tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum) embryos and larvae held in in situ enclosures. We found that higher ammonium concentrations negatively affect R. sylvatica more strongly than A. tigrinum. R. sylvatica tended to have lower survival as embryos and young tadpoles, slowed embryonic development, and an increased proportion of hatchlings with deformities at experimentally elevated ammonium. A. tigrinum did not experience significantly reduced survival, but their larval development was slowed in response to elevated ammonium and the abundance of large invertebrate predators. Variable species susceptibility, such as that shown by R sylvatica and A. tigrinum, could have large indirect effects on aquatic community structure through modification of competitive or predator-prey relationships. Ammonium and nitrate + nitrite concentrations were not correlated with other measures that might have affected amphibians, such as pH, pond area, depth, or vegetation. Our results highlight the potential importance of elevated ammonium on the growth, development and survival of amphibians, especially those that breed in surface waters receiving anthropogenic N inputs. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Many studies have revealed that lineages currently inhabiting formerly glaciated areas were pushed into southern glacial refugia and have expanded into their modern range since the last glacial maximum. There have been few studies that compare the effects of glacial cycles on lineage diversification and historical demography in closely related species with overlapping ranges. In this study we compare phylogeographic structure, historical demography, and approximate lineage age in two closely related and broadly co-occurring venomous snakes in eastern North America, the cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus) and copperhead (A. contortrix) using sequences from the mtDNA gene cytochrome b. We inferred three geographic lineages of A. contortrix and two of A. piscivorus with no common geographic or temporal pattern of lineage diversification identified for these species. Lineage diversification occurred in the Late Pliocene for A. piscivorus (∼2.5 mya) and in the Early Pleistocene for A. contortrix (∼1.5 mya). Demographic estimates revealed population expansion following the last glacial maximum (∼20,000 years ago) in two lineages of A. contortrix (the Central clade and Eastern clade) and one lineage of A. piscivorus (the Continental clade). The Florida clade of A. piscivorus is the only lineage for which constant population size through time was inferred, possibly due to stable populations persisting in areas unaffected by glacial advances. Our data suggest that unique habitat preferences may have shaped both the phylogeographic and demographic histories of each species. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Amphibian metamorphosis assays are used to evaluate potential effects of endocrine disrupting compounds on the thyroid hormone axis. In this study, Xenopus laevis tadpoles are kept in a solution of 0.2% thiourea (TU) to arrest and synchronise them in their development. The advantage of this synchronized amphibian metamorphosis assays is that synchronised tadpoles are available at any time to start metamorphosis experiments, and experimental groups are much more homogenous at the start of experimental exposure compared with groups selected from an untreated pool of animals. The water volume per animal was kept constant throughout the experimental period to overcome the influence of declining numbers of animals per aquarium due to metamorphosis and mortality on the density dependent development of the remaining tadpoles. Clophen A50 (a technical PCB mixture), the single congener 3,3′,4,4′-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 77) and apolar sediment extracts that were previously tested positive in the T-Screen, an in vitro proliferation assay for thyroid hormone disruption, were tested in the Synchronized Amphibian Metamorphosis Assay. Endpoints studied were mortality, malformations, body weight, and percentage of metamorphosed froglets at the end of the 60-day experimental period, percentage of tadpoles in different developmental stages, and developmental stage-dependent awarded penalty points. Dietary exposure to Clophen A50 (0.2-50 mg/kg food) resulted in a significant increased percentage of tadpoles that did not pass metamorphosis at concentrations higher than 2 mg/kg food. Time until metamorphosis in those animals that were able to metamorphose after the 60-days experimental period was significantly decreased. Dietary exposure to PCB 77, a congener that can be readily metabolised, did not result in significant effects in any exposure group (2-500 $\mu$g/kg food). Apolar sediment extracts from two of the three sites that are contaminated with a wide variety of chemicals significantly decreased the percentage of metamorphosed animals and significantly increased the number of tadpoles that remained in early and late metamorphic stages. These effects already occurred when the extracts where diluted more than 1000 times (on an organic carbon base) compared to environmental concentrations.

We investigated the association between temperature, habitat selection, and thermoregulation in a population of massasauga rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus) near their northern range limit, where low temperatures are likely an important constraint. Movement data indicated that the lower limit of the massasauga's performance range (i.e., >= 50% of optimal) was 19.9 [degree]C. Operative environmental temperatures were almost always below the massasauga's preferred range (30.0-33.6 [degree]C) and frequently below its performance range in spring and fall. Massasaugas differed from other northern snakes by thermoregulating primarily by microhabitat selection and not by macrohabitat selection. Massasaugas thermoregulated more effectively as their visibility increased and forest cover decreased. Gravid females increased thermoregulatory behaviour in response to low temperatures in spring and summer. Male and nongravid female massasaugas did not take full advantage of thermoregulatory opportunities in the spring and fall, and as a consequence were often too cool to perform essential functions such as prey capture. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that temperature limits massasauga distribution primarily via effects on gestation and hence juvenile recruitment.},

abstract = {1. The 'hydrogeomorphic' approach to functional assessment of wetlands (HGM) was developed as a synthetic mechanism for compensatory mitigation of wetlands lost or damaged by human activities. The HGM approach is based on: (a) classification of wetlands by geomorphic origin and hydrographic regime (b) assessment models that associate variables as indicators of function, and (c) comparison to reference wetlands that represent the range of conditions that may be expected in a particular region. In this paper, we apply HGM to riparian wetlands of alluvial rivers. 2. In the HGM classification, riverine wetlands are characterized by formative fluvial processes that occur mainly on flood plains. The dominant water sources are overbank flooding from the channel or subsurface hyporheic flows. Examples of riverine wetlands in the U.S.A. are: bottomland hardwood forests that typify the low gradient, fine texture substratum of the south-eastern coastal plain and the alluvial flood plains that typify the high gradient, coarse texture substratum of western montane rivers. 3. Assessment (logic) models for each of fourteen alluvial wetland functions are described. Each model is a composite of two to seven wetland variables that are independently scored in relation to a reference data set developed for alluvial rivers in the western U.S.A. Scores are summarized by a 'functional capacity index' (FCI), which is multiplied by the area of the project site to produce a dimensionless 'functional capacity unit' (FCU). When HGM is properly used, compensatory mitigation is based on the FCUs lost that must be returned to the riverine landscape under statutory authority. 4. The HGM approach also provides a framework for long-term monitoring of mitigation success or failure and, if failing, a focus on topical remediation. 5. We conclude that HGM is a robust and easy method for protecting riparian wetlands, which are critically important components of alluvial river landscapes.},

abstract = {Amphibian populations are declining globally at an alarming rate. Pesticides are among a number of proposed causes for these declines. Although a sizable database examining effects of pesticides on amphibians exists, the vast majority of these studies focus on toxicological effects (lethality, external malformations, etc.) at relatively high doses (parts per million). Very few studies focus on effects such as endocrine disruption at low concentrations. Further, most studies examine exposures to single chemicals only. The present study examined nine pesticides (four herbicides, two fungicides, and three insecticides) used on cornfields in the midwestern United States. Effects of each pesticide alone (0.1 ppb) or in combination were examined. In addition, we also examined atrazine and S-metolachlor combined (0.1 or 10 ppb each) and the commercial formulation Bicep II Magnum, which contains both of these herbicides. These two pesticides were examined in combination because they are persistent throughout the year in the wild. We examined larval growth and development, sex differentiation, and immune function in leopard frogs (Rana pipiens). In a follow-up study, we also examined the effects of the nine-compound mixture on plasma corticosterone levels in male African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis). Although some of the pesticides individually inhibited larval growth and development, the pesticide mixtures had much greater effects. Larval growth and development were retarded, but most significantly, pesticide mixtures negated or reversed the typically positive correlation between time to metamorphosis and size at metamorphosis observed in controls: exposed larvae that took longer to metamorphose were smaller than their counterparts that metamorphosed earlier. The nine-pesticide mixture also induced damage to the thymus, resulting in immunosuppression and contraction of flavobacterial meningitis. The study in X. laevis revealed that these adverse effects may be due to an increase in plasma levels of the stress hormone corticosterone. Although it cannot be determined whether all the pesticides in the mixture contribute to these adverse effects or whether some pesticides are effectors, some are enhancers, and some are neutral, the present study revealed that estimating ecological risk and the impact of pesticides on amphibians using studies that examine only single pesticides at high concentrations may lead to gross underestimations of the role of pesticides in amphibian declines.},

It has progressed from a largely inductive science performed on an expeditionary basis to a laboratory-based discipline in which preformed hypotheses are tested empirically. My research has spanned that change in paradigm and an example of expeditionary biology, the study of habitat selection by amphibians and reptiles in the Darien Gap, Panama, is described. The study of Sea Snakes is used to illustrate the transition. Analysis of the offerings to two herpetological journals, Herpetologica and the Journal of Herpetology, also demonstrates changes in different topical emphases. A prominent trend in herpetology has been a shift from basic biology to conservation in the face of environmental degradation and the need to preserve the biodiversity of amphibians and reptiles. The unified biology of antiquity had fragmented into separate, specialized disciplines that seldom related to each other in more than a general way, despite the encompassing generalization of adaptation through evolution. In the past decade there has been a great melding of disciplines and a return to a more-holistic melding of disparate areas of biological endeavor. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We investigated Dekay's\nBrownsnake microhabitat use during annual surveys at Point Pelee National Park, Ontario, Canada from 1990 to 2010. We systematically\nchecked all woody debris in stabilized dune habitat for snakes and noted the size and state of decay of woody debris that was used. Nearly all\nof our observations were of gravid females under woody debris. Greater use of large, moderately decayed woody debris relative to the range of\navailable debris provided strong evidence of selection. Although most snakes observed were solitary, we found a significant number of\naggregations. Female Brownsnakes appear to migrate to stabilized dune from other habitats in the park to select suitable woody debris for\ngestation and parturition. Although these refuge sites would reduce predation risk, they also provide a moister and cooler microclimate than\nambient conditions. Numerous observations of shed skins also suggested that this woody debris provides important microhabitat for ecdysis.\nAnalysis of relative abundance over time showed considerable variation in numbers (1--1/yr) and an increasing trend. Our results provide\nstrong evidence of microhabitat selection by this species and highlight the importance of not making generalizations about microhabitat\nrequirements, even for common snake species.},

abstract = {Created riverine wetlands play an important role in nitrate removal from non-point source pollution. In this study, we investigated the effect of flooding frequency on seasonal denitrification rates in two created riverine wetlands in the Midwest USA receiving controlled hydrologic pulses. Denitrification was measured using the in situ acetylene block technique; sampling plots were distributed in a longitudinal gradient, i.e., along the water flow and in a transverse gradient from the edge to the center of the wetlands. Flood frequency plots in the transverse gradient were influenced by hidrological pulses as follows: low marsh and open water zones were permanently flooded, high marsh zones had permanently saturated soils, but standing water during pulses, and edge zones were normally dry with standing water during flood pulses. Denitrification was significantly correlated with soil temperature in all plots and with growing season nitrate concentrations in the inflow surface water in permanently flooded plots. Late spring denitrification rates in the high marsh zone were significantly higher under flood pulsing (778 ± 92 $\mu$g N m-2 h-1) than under steady flow (328 ± 63 $\mu$g N m-2 h-1). In the low marsh and edge zones, flood pulses did not affect denitrification. N2O/N2 ratios were higher in intermittently flooded (high marsh and edge) zones than in permanently flooded (low marsh) zones and ratios increased in the cold seasons. Highest mean denitrification rates were observed in the low marsh zone (800 ± 102 $\mu$g N m-2 h-1) and they were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the high marsh (458 ± 87 $\mu$g N m-2 h-1) and edge (315 ± 40 $\mu$g N m-2 h-1) zones, but not significantly different from the open water zone (584 ± 101 $\mu$g N m-2 h-1). Denitrification in high marsh zones was not significantly different than in the open water and edge zones. In permanently flooded areas, denitrification rates were significantly higher near the wetland inflow than near the outflow, which was related to nitrate concentrations in the water column. Denitrification appeared to be nitrogen-limited in the low marsh, high marsh, and edge plots, but both carbon- and nitrogen-limited in open water. Flood frequency, nitrate availability, and soil temperature were important factors controlling denitrification rates in these created wetlands. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Life histories of a species often vary geographically, and comparative studies of populations in different habitats are useful for understanding how environmental variation influences life history. Such studies are currently lacking for most snake species despite their growing importance as model organisms for life history studies. We present life history data for a population of Western Cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma) inhabiting a "riffle-pool" creek system (Rocky Grove) located in the Ozark Mountains in northwest Arkansas and compare our results with those available for other populations. One hundred forty-two individual snakes were captured 283 times from August 1996 through September 2003. Mean snout-vent length (SVL) of adult Rocky Grove A. piscivorus (males 60.8 [plus or minus] 2.68 cm, n = 47, females 54.9 [plus or minus] 1.74 cm, n = 47) was among the smallest reported for any population of A. piscivorus. Rocky Grove A. piscivorus also exhibited a low degree of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) compared to other localities, and mean female SVL was 90.3% that of males. Growth rates were the slowest reported for any temperate zone pitviper (males 0.151 [plus or minus] 0.053 cm/month, n = 46, females 0.178 [plus or minus] 0.06 cm/month, n = 66). Limited data also Indicate low reproductive output for this population in terms of frequency of reproduction and litter size. Female reproduction averaged less than biennial as evidenced by consistently low proportion of pregnant to non-pregnant females (18.4%) and reproductive histories of individual female snakes. Litter size averaged 4.1 [plus or minus] 0.63 (n = 10). Mating at Rocky Grove occurs in late summer but may also occur in spring. Agkistrodon piscivorus at this study site may be limited in energy acquisition rates relative to the conspecifics in other parts of the range.},

Snakes offered prey (juvenile spotted bass, Micropterus punctulatus) at low densities (five fish/enclosure/week) had significantly lower proportional changes in mass than snakes offered prey at high densities (10 fish/enclosure/week). However, differences in mass changes of N. sipedon were not significant at constant relative densities of prey to snakes. Nerodia sipedon and N. rhombifer that were offered 10 fish per week and tested individually had significantly higher mass changes than snakes tested in intraspecific pairs. For snakes maintained in interspecific pairs and offered 10 fish per week, N. sipedon had higher mass changes than N. rhombifer, although the difference was not significant. I lab-tested the potential for exploitation as a mechanism of competition between N. sipedon and N. rhombifer by com- paring rates of gastric breakdown after feeding snakes a goldfish (Carassius auratus), forcing regurgitation at six, 12, and 18 h after ingestion, and comparing ash-free dry masses (AFDMs) of the digested fish. Rel- atively higher AFDMs of digested fish were obtained from N. sipedon than from N. rhombifer at six and 12 hours after ingestion. Thus, the former species exhibited a faster rate of gastric breakdown than the latter. These differences in competitive abilities may potentially contribute to the higher abundance of N. sipedon than N. rhombifer in the upper Pascagoula River system of southeastern Mississi},

Building on Hutchinson's concept of the ecological niche, this factor analysis compares, in the multidimensional space of ecological variables, the distribution of the localities where the focal species was observed to a reference set describing the whole study area. The first factor extracted maximizes the marginality of the focal species, defined as the ecological distance between the species optimum and the mean habitat within the reference area. The other factors maximize the specialization of this focal species, defined as the ratio of the ecological variance in mean habitat to that observed for the focal species. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are readily interpreted and can be used to build habitat-suitability maps. This approach is recommended in situations where absence data are not available (many data banks), unreliable (most cryptic or rare species), or meaningless (invaders). We provide an illustration and validation of the method for the alpine ibex, a species reintroduced in Switzerland which presumably has not yet recolonized its entire range.},

abstract = {G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed that one could characterize the ecological niche of a species as an abstract mapping of population dynamics onto an environmental space, the axes of which are abiotic and biotic factors that influence birth and death rates. If a habitat has conditions within a species' niche, a population should persist without immigration from external sources, whereas if conditions are outside the niche, it faces extinction. Analyses of species' niches are essential to understanding controls on species' geographical range limits and how these limits might shift in our rapidly changing world. Recent developments in ecology and evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and refine Hutchinson's niche concept. After reviewing techniques for quantifying niches, I examine subtleties that arise because of impacts species have on their own environments, the density-dependent modulation of how individuals experience environments, and the interplay of dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining population persistence. Moreover, the evolutionary record over all time scales reveals a spectrum of rates of change in species' niches, from rapid niche evolution to profound niche conservatism. Substantial challenges revolving around the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian niche include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific and clade-level variation in niches and understanding the factors that govern where along the spectrum of potential evolutionary rates any given lineage lies. A growing body of theory provides elements of a conceptual framework for understanding niche conservatism and evolution, paving the way for an evolutionary theory of the niche.},

abstract = {Neonate-directed care is rare in non-avian reptiles, but female pitvipers attend their young for a period of time after birth. One of the primary functions of parental care is the protection of offspring from predators, and parents of diverse taxa are able to modulate their antipredator behavior in the presence of offspring. To test the hypothesis that the antipredator behavior of post-parturient pitvipers is altered during neonate attendance, we conducted behavioral trials on female cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorus) in which we measured female response to a simulated predator encounter. Cottonmouths were divided into three treatment groups: (1) post-parturient, attending neonates; (2) post-parturient, not attending neonates; and (3) non-reproductive. All females were subjected to a second trial approximately 3 wk later, when females in Group 1 were no longer attending neonates. When mothers were attending offspring, they were more hesitant to engage the predator and exhibited more warning than aggressive behaviors once they did, relative to non-attending and non-reproductive females. When these same mothers were no longer attending offspring, they significantly increased their antipredator behavior by engaging the predator quickly and displaying more aggressive than warning behaviors. This change in behavior was not observed in post-parturient females who did not have neonates present during either trial, nor was it observed in non-reproductive females, indicating that the presence of neonates directly affected the antipredator behavior of attending females. We discuss hypotheses concerning the possible adaptive value of reduced antipredator behavior in female pitvipers attending neonates.},

abstract = {Landscape composition and configuration affect ecological processes at the population and community levels, but few studies have demonstrated the effects of landscape pattern on individuals. Because heterogeneity influences abundance and distribution of critical resources, it is hypothesized that it indirectly affects home range size of individuals. To examine the spatial ecology of the declining Eastern Diamond-backed Rattlesnake (Crotalus adatnanteus; EDB), we conducted a two-year study in southwestern Georgia. We obtained home range estimates via radio-telemetry, employed Euclidean distance analysis to examine habitat associations at two spatial scales, and used the software program FRAG STATS to analyze landscape heterogeneity and examine its effect on home range size. Although no significant habitat associations were detected, there were trends for a positive association with pine habitat at the landscape scale and a negative association with agriculture within the home range. Home range size was negatively correlated with several landscape metrics representing heterogeneity in patch configuration, such that individuals in heterogeneous landscapes had small home ranges. This relationship was strongest at three spatial scales: the first was similar to mean home range size of EDBs; and the others were three and four times as large as the largest home range recorded. Together, these results suggest that management regimes to enhance population densities of EDBs emphasize the preservation of pine uplands, while maintaining a mosaic of other habitat types, and limit the conversion of forest to agriculture. Also, our results underscore the importance of using robust analytical tools and multiscale approaches in studies of spatial eco},

abstract = {1. The ecology of riparian zones is enormously influenced by the heterogeneous sedimentary structures and associated complex hydrologic flow paths that mediate surface- and groundwater exchanges. Sedimentary structures form a three-dimensional, dynamic framework that controls subsurface flow and the vertical and horizontal exchange of water between channels and floodplains in gravel bed rivers. The modern structure of the bed sediments reflects the legacy of cut and fill alluviation for a particular river basin. 2. Highly permeable sedimentary textures, particularly open framework gravels, allow rapid exchange between surface and groundwaters. 3. Ground penetrating radar provides high resolution information on the nature and three-dimensional distribution of the sediments within the shallow subsurface (4-25 m) of gravel bed rivers. Bed sediments can be mapped at the decimeter scale. 4. Exchange and mixing of ground and channel water occurs along losing, gaining and flow-through reaches as determined by the hydraulic gradient and transmissivity of the bed sediments. 5. Spatial and temporal patterns of surface- and groundwater interactions can be quantified by mass flux measurements and by assessing geochemical contrasts. Natural tracers, such as temperature or radon, are well suited for mapping exchange sites and quantifying interactions. Artificial signals produced by injecting anions, like chloride, bromide and organic dyes are also useful. 6. The study of riparian ecosystems requires an understanding of the geomorphic structures and processes that build and maintain bed sediments and flow pathways through them.},

The hydroperiod, or annual period of inundation, largely controls the development of characteristic fluvial landforms, sediment deposition and vegetation distribution patterns.

Substantial sediment (and adsorbed contaminants) retention and storage through lateral and vertical accretion is common (where not heavily impacted by flow regulation) along these Coastal Plain rivers.

abstract = {Economists at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are regularly called upon to assess the anticipated benefits and costs of rules proposed to implement environmental legislation. These laws reflect a concern for both human and ecological health, and the increased flow of ecosystem services is a significant source of benefit. This is particularly true for the Clean Water Act (CWA), one goal of which is to safeguard aquatic habitat. Because the benefit-cost analyses must be completed within mandated deadlines, the approaches taken to assess benefits are often expedient ones that have already survived the gauntlet of review both within and outside the agency. This engenders a strong bias toward the benefits transfer approach and particular variants of it. In this paper, we review how ecological benefits have been assessed for and benefits transfer applied to seven EPA rules issued under the CWA. We highlight common themes and point out recurring concerns. Some concerns relate to agency decisions regarding the treatment of a particular benefit category and could be dealt with relatively easily. Other concerns will require the support of an engaged research community to improve the fit of valuation studies to policy contexts and to ensure that the changes in ecological response to which benefit estimates are being transferred are accurately measured. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we compare locomotory speed of two species of natricine snakes on land and in water at a range of temperatures in the laboratory. As expected, both species moved more quickly at higher temperatures and both swam faster than they moved on land. However, the difference between aquatic and terrestrial speed was much greater for the aquatic species, Natrix maura, than for the semi-aquatic Natrix natrix. Furthermore, although N. maura was significantly faster than N. natrix in water, the opposite was true on land. In fact, N. maura was reluctant to move very far on land at all and would not complete a 2 m terrestrial course. Although we found no evidence of a negative correlation between the aquatic and terrestrial speeds of individual N. natrix, this interspecific comparison is consistent with the notion of a tradeoff between performance abilities on land and in water. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {Calf (Bos taurus) depredation by the federally endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) on ranches in southwest Florida is an important issue because ranches represent mixed landscapes that provide habitat critical to panther recovery. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify calf depredation by panthers on two ranches in southwest Florida, and (2) develop a habitat suitability model to evaluate the quality of panther hunting habitat on ranchlands, assess whether the model could predict predation risk to calves, and discuss its potential to be incorporated into an incentive-based compensation program. We ear-tagged 409 calves with VHF transmitters on two ranches during 2011-2013 to document calf mortality. We developed a model to evaluate the quality of panther hunting habitat on private lands in southwest Florida using environmental variables obtained from the Florida Natural Areas Inventory (FNAI) Cooperative Landcover Database and nocturnal GPS locations of panthers provided by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). We then tested whether the model could predict the location of calf depredation sites. Tagged calf loss to panthers varied between the two ranches (0.5%/yr to 5.3%/yr) and may have been influenced by the amount of panther hunting habitat on each ranch as the ranch that experienced higher depredation rates contained a significantly higher probability of panther presence. Depredation sites of tagged calves had a significantly greater probability of panther presence than depredation sites of untagged calves that were found by ranchers in open pastures. This suggests that there may be more calves killed in high risk environments than are being found and reported by ranchers and that panthers can hunt effectively in open environments. It also suggests that the model may provide a means for evaluating the quality of panther hunting habitat and the corresponding risk of depredation to livestock across the landscape. We suggest that our approach could be applied to prioritize and categorize private lands for participation in a Payment for Ecosystem Services program that compensates landowners for livestock loss and incentivizes conserving high quality habitat for large carnivores where livestock depredation is a concern.},

abstract = {Nearly two decades ago, the global biodiversity crisis was catapulted to the front pages of newspapers with the recognition of worldwide amphibian declines. Amphibians earned their appellation, 'canaries in a coal mine', because of apparent high sensitivity to human-mediated environmental change. The most frequently cited causes for high susceptibility include permeable skin, a dual aquatic-terrestrial life cycle and a relatively rudimentary immune system. While some researchers have questioned the basis for the canary assertion, there has been no systematic evaluation of amphibian sensitivity to environmental challenges relative to other taxa. Here, we apply a database representing thousands of toxicity tests to compare the responses of amphibians relative to that of other taxonomic groups. The use of standardized methods combined with large numbers of identical challenges enables a particularly powerful test of relative effect size. Overall, we found that amphibians only exhibit moderate relative responses to water-borne toxins. Our findings imply that, as far as chemical contaminants are concerned, amphibians are not particularly sensitive and might more aptly be described as 'miners in a coal mine'. To the extent that amphibian declines have been mediated by chemical contaminants, our findings suggest that population losses and extinctions may have already occurred in a variety of taxa much more sensitive than amphibians. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Ontogenetic habitat shifts have been documented in numerous fish and amphibians and in some reptiles. Intraspecific competition together with differential predation, prey size, social interactions, size-related thermal requirements, and morphological constraints on movement are often implicated in this ontogenetic habitat separation. In the current study, we combined field observation with experiments in seminatural arenas to test various hypotheses regarding the ontogenetic habitat shift that we have documented in the common chameleon. Juveniles (mean, 1 g) occupied low grasses and the adults (mean, 35 g) were found on bushes and trees. Overlap in habitat use between these two age classes was minimal. Our field experiments showed that juveniles actively avoid the presence of adults by concealment or flight. Adults readily attacked and consumed juveniles, regardless of their own mass. These results suggest that the risk of cannibalism towards juveniles is an important selective force behind the ontogenetic habitat shift observed in the common chameleon and may be important in other species too. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

More than 80 taxa dominate or codominate in at least one division of at least one of the 530 wetlands from which data were obtained. Communities dominated by each of 16 of these taxa occur in 10 or more wetlands and vary in mean richness from 4 to 18 species, richness increasing towards the margins of wetlands, with the area of wetland, and with decreasing salinity. A combination of salinity and permanence indices explains over one-third of the floristic variation between these communities; within freshwater wetlands, pH has more influence than the permanence index. The Tasmanian wetland flora is a subset of that of mainland Australia. Most Tasmanian wetland plant communities probably occur on the Australian mainland. Many of the wetland vegetation types discriminated on the mainland do not occur in Tasmanian non-tidal wetlands.},

abstract = {We studied occupancy, species richness, abundance, and size distributions of snakes on habitat patches that ranged from 0.2 to 120 ha within a landscape undergoing substantial land-use changes. Additionally, we examined the role of intraguild predation in structuring snake communities by equipping five racers (Coluber constrictor, the largest snake in our study area) with transmitters, and then compared the abundance of smaller snakes within areas of intensive (75% isopleth home range) and limited activity (outside of 75% isopleth) by racers. As expected, small patches (< 1.5 ha) often were vacant or occupied by only one species (garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis). Species richness was greatest on large patches, and snakes also tended to be more abundant on large patches. Counter to our expectations, the proportion of large-bodied individuals on small patches was greater. The distribution of small-bodied snakes on one large patch may have been affected by racers because the proportion of small snakes was less in areas intensively used by racers. Additionally, the abundance of the most generalist species in our study (garter snakes) was less in areas of intensive use by racers. In the northeastern United States, populations from a variety of taxonomic groups (including insects, migratory songbirds, mammals, and snakes) are rapidly declining in response to the loss of early-successional habitats. Our study lends support to current initiatives that recommend restoration and maintenance of parcels of early-successional habitats to sustain regional biological diversity. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Available habitat within a landscape is often more limited for specialist species than for generalists. Therefore, specialists are potentially more vulnerable to extinction. The goal of our study was to better understand the ephemeral wetland habitat associations of specialist and generalist amphibians within a longleaf pine landscape in the southeastern United States. We also sought to determine specialist (e.g., oak toad [Anaxyrus quercicus], Maybee's salamander [Ambystoma maybeei], pine woods treefrog [Hyla femoralis], carpenter frog [Lithobates virgatipes]) and generalist (e.g., spotted salamander [Ambystoma maculatum], Cope's gray treefrog [Hyla chrysoscelis], southern leopard frog [Lithobates sphenocephalus]) species' responses to specific habitat restoration treatments. From 2005–2010, we examined the relationship between aquatic specialist and generalist amphibian species occupancy and wetland vegetation structure. We measured vegetation and amphibian responses to prescribed fire and vegetation mulching (a fire surrogate), plus a combination of mulching and burning. Untreated controls were wetlands that had not burned for 4–15 years. We combined data from this study and a previous study to elucidate patterns in amphibian assemblages in relation to fire history. Specialist relative species richness was highest when canopy openness was high and leaf litter depth was low, conditions best achieved by mulching plus burning. Some specialist species were not detected in wetlands with >8 years since fire, and some generalist species were not detected in wetlands with <2 years since fire, indicating that as vegetation structure changes with time since fire, there is a corresponding shift in the amphibian assemblage. Important patterns in species distributions can be overlooked if relationships to environment and responses to habitat change are too generalized and do not account for shifts in community composition. For conservation of longleaf pine specialist species, we recommend that uplands continue to be prescribed-burned on a 1–3-year return interval. Burning should occur during the early growing season when possible to maximize the probability that wetland basins burn. In cases where species of high conservation value are at imminent risk of extinction, we recommend a combination of mulching and burning to most quickly restore suitable habitat structure. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract = {Several environmental chemicals are known to have estrogenic activity by interacting with development and functions of endocrine systems in nearly all classes of vertebrates. In order to get a better insight of potential estrogenic effects on amphibians caused by environmental pollution this study aims to develop a model for investigating endocrine disruptors using the amphibian Xenopus laevis. In that model the potential estrogenic activity of endocrine disruptors is determined at several levels of investigation: (I) binding to liver estrogen receptor; (II) estrogenicity in vitro by inducing vitellogenin synthesis in primary cultured hepatocytes; and (III) in vivo effects on sexual development. Here we deal with establishing methods to assay estrogenic activity of environmental chemicals in vitro and in vivo. In vitro we used a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique to determine mRNA-induction of the estrogenic biomarker vitellogenin in primary cultured hepatocytes of male Xenopus laevis. Time courses of vitellogenin-mRNA in the presence and absence of 10-6 M 17$\beta$-estradiol (E2) resulted in a marked loss of mRNA from controls after 2 days while E2 treatment kept vitellogenin-mRNA at a relatively stable level. After 36 h of incubation estrogenic activities of E2, 4-nonylphenol (NP), and 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propan (bisphenol A) at concentrations ranging from 10-10 to 10-5 M were assayed by RT-PCR of vitellogenin-mRNA and showed the following ranking of dose-dependent potency: E2>NP>bisphenol A. These in vitro results were confirmed further by in vivo experiments determining sexual differentiation of Xenopus laevis after exposure to E2 and environmental chemicals during larval development. Concentrations of 10-7 and 10-8 M E2 as well as 10-7 M of NP or bisphenol A caused a significant higher number of female phenotypes compared to controls indicating a similar ranking of estrogenic potencies in vivo as in vitro. In addition, butylhydroxyanisol and octylphenol, both showed feminization at 10-7 M while octylphenol was also effective at 10-8 M. In summary these results demonstrate for the first time the use of a semiquantitative RT-PCR technique for screening estrogenicity by assaying mRNA induction of the estrogenic biomarker vitellogenin in vitro. The combination of this newly developed method with classical exposure experiments is necessary for determination of the biological significance of estrogenic chemicals.

abstract = {To provide the first nationwide reconnaissance of the occurrence of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and other organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) in water resources, the U.S. Geological Survey used five newly developed analytical methods to measure concentrations of 95 OWCs in water samples from a network of 139 streams across 30 states during 1999 and 2000. The selection of sampling sites was biased toward streams susceptible to contamination (i.e. downstream of intense urbanization and livestock production). OWCs were prevalent during this study, being found in 80% of the streams sampled. The compounds detected represent a wide range of residential, industrial, and agricultural origins and uses with 82 of the 95 OWCs being found during this study. The most frequently detected compounds were coprostanol (fecal steroid), cholesterol (plant and animal steroid), N,N-diethyltoluamide (insect repellant), caffeine (stimulant), triclosan (antimicrobial disinfectant), tri(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (fire retardant), and 4-nonylphenol (nonionic detergent metabolite). Measured concentrations for this study were generally low and rarely exceeded drinking-water guidelines, drinking-water health advisories, or aquatic-life criteria. Many compounds, however, do not have such guidelines established. The detection of multiple OWCs was common for this study, with a median of seven and as many as 38 OWCs being found in a given water sample. Little is known about the potential interactive effects (such as synergistic or antagonistic toxicity) that may occur from complex mixtures of OWCs in the environment. In addition, results of this study demonstrate the importance of obtaining data on metabolites to fully understand not only the fate and transport of OWCs in the hydrologic system but also their ultimate overall effect on human health and the environment.},

abstract = {In an effort to improve knowledge of Cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus) life history and behavior, we conducted a capture-mark-recapture study in Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama over four years to examine the influence of body size on survival, recapture probabilities, and behavior; as well as monitor change in the population's body-size distribution over time. Our estimate of annual Cottonmouth survival (0.79) is among the highest reported for all snakes. Although we did not detect an effect of body size on survival, the probability of recapturing individuals increased with body size up to a snout-vent-length of 82 cm, after which it remained approximately constant. Relative to large snakes, small snakes were more likely to be found in a resting coil and less likely to move away from researchers, suggesting that our lower probability of recapturing small snakes was not due to behavioral avoidance of researchers but perhaps dispersal patterns or microhabitat use. Furthermore, the observed frequency of snakes <= 30 cm in length increased each year, indicative of an increase in recruitment over time. Our findings provide new information about Cottonmouth life history, and we suggest future paths of research that could further enhance knowledge of Cottonmouth demography and population dynamics.},

Nerodia erythrogaster neglecta were observed primarily along shorelines with gentle slopes near very shallow water and often used herbaceous vegetation, logs, grasses, and sedges substrate categories. Nerodia sipedon pleuralis used habitat most similar to N. e. neglecta. Although N. s. pleuralis were observed to be more aquatic and were more often found in open water, they showed the same close association with shorelines and basking substrates as N. e. neglecta. Nerodia rhombifer is the least selective in habitat use of the three species and is the least similar in habitat use to N. e. neglecta in this study. As a whole, the results of this study support previous research that suggests N. e. neglecta is a seasonal habitat specialist.

abstract = {Temperature influences ectotherm fitness by affecting physiological performance. Terrestrial reptiles behaviourally regulate their body temperature by selecting particular microhabitats or activity periods. In temperate climates, thermal constraints make precise thermoregulation costly. Theoretical models of thermoregulation predict that species in cool environments should exhibit lower optimal temperature for performance and lower thermal preferences to minimize thermoregulatory costs. Empirical data in support of this prediction remain equivocal because several species maintain high and constant body temperatures, even in cool environments. We studied two largely sympatric colubrid snakes, Hierophis viridiflavus and Zamenis longissimus that share numerous morphological and ecological similarities, but differ markedly in thermal preference. Our objective was to quantify their thermoregulatory strategies in the field to determine how thermal preferences translate in habitat use and performance gain. The thermophilic species, H. viridiflavus, selected open microhabitats, whereas Z. longissimus, which prefers cooler temperatures, used a greater diversity of microhabitats. The two species differed markedly in their exposure levels. Hierophis viridiflavus was constrained to shuttle between sun and shade to maintain preferred body temperatures rendering it very exposed, while covered microhabitats were usually thermally compatible with the requirements of Z. longissimus. High exposure was apparently counterbalanced by higher locomotor performances in H. viridiflavus. The divergence in thermal ecology between Z. longissimus and H. viridiflavus likely reflects different trade-offs between energy gain and predator avoidance.},

In this paper, predictive habitat models were assessed for three invasive plant species, at differing levels of occurrence, using two different habitat modeling techniques: logistic regression and maximum entropy. The influence of disturbance, spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and other landscape characteristics is assessed by creating regional level models based on occurrence records from the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis database. Logistic regression and maximum entropy models were assessed independently. Ensemble models were developed to combine the predictions of the two analysis approaches to obtain a more robust prediction estimate. All species had strong models with Area Under the receiver operator Curve (AUC) of >0.75. The species with the highest occurrence, Ligustrum spp., had the greatest agreement between the models (93%). Lolium arundinaceum had the most disagreement between models at 33% and the lowest AUC values.

abstract = {Heart position relative to total body length (TL) varies among snakes, with anterior hearts in arboreal species and more centrally located hearts in aquatic or ground-dwelling species. Anterior hearts decrease the cardiac work associated with cranial blood flow and minimize drops in cranial pressure and flow during head-up climbing. Here, we investigate whether heart position shifts intraspecifically during ontogenetic increases in TL. Insular Florida cottonmouth snakes, Agkistrodon conanti, are entirely ground-dwelling and have a mean heart position that is 33.32% TL from the head. In contrast, arboreal rat snakes, Pantherophis obsoleta, of similar lengths have a mean heart position that is 17.35% TL from the head. In both species, relative heart position shifts craniad during ontogeny, with negative slopes = -.035 and -.021% TL/cm TL in Agkistrodon and Pantherophis, respectively. Using a large morphometric data set available for Agkistrodon (N = 192 individuals, 23-140 cm TL), we demonstrate there is an anterior ontogenetic shift of the heart position within the trunk (= 4.56% trunk length from base of head to cloacal vent), independent of head and tail allometry which are both negative. However, in longer snakes > 100 cm, the heart position reverses and shifts caudally in longer Agkistrodon but continues toward the head in longer individuals of Pantherophis. Examination of data sets for two independent lineages of fully marine snakes (Acrochordus granulatus and Hydrophis platurus), which do not naturally experience postural gravity stress, demonstrate both ontogenetic patterns for heart position that are seen in the terrestrial snakes. The anterior migration of the heart is greater in the terrestrial species, even if TL is standardized to that of the longer P. obsoleta, and compensates for about 5 mmHg gravitational pressure head if they are fully upright.},

abstract = {Florida cottonmouth snakes (Agkistrodon piscivorus conanti) inhabit insular as well as mainland habitat, and they occur in particularly large numbers on some of the Gulf coast islands of Florida. The success of this species on islands is attributable, in part, to a broad trophic niche that encompasses many prey items including carrion. Numerous cottonmouths living on the island of Seahorse Key consume primarily dead fish that are dropped from colonial nesting bird rookeries, but they also prey on rats (Rattus rattus) that are invasive fauna on the island. While alternative prey items (e.g. lizards) are available to newborn snakes, smaller individuals also scavenge for fish carrion at early ages. Field observations indicate there is social structure during foraging events that involve multiple snakes. Occasionally, insular cottonmouths scavenge for intertidal carrion and detritus that washes onto beaches. Numerous and diverse objects of appropriate size, shape, and odor are ingested by foraging snakes, including masses of marine algae that bear fish odors. The intensive scavenging behaviors of cottonmouths appear to reflect behavioral and physiological specializations that have evolved in response to insular resource limitations. Two important pathways by which allochthonous marine productivity enters the terrestrial food web to support these insular cottonmouths are (I) colonial bird rookeries and (2) shore drift of carrion and detritus. The importance of the bird rookeries as a source of marine fish is reflected in the observation that far lower numbers of cottonmouths occur on islands that lack a bird colony. We have no evidence that the insular cottonmouths feed on the colonial nesting birds, but they consume smaller passerine species.},

abstract = {We report a genus-wide comparison of venom proteome variation across New World pit vipers in the genus Agkistrodon. Despite the wide variety of habitats occupied by this genus and that all its taxa feed on diverse species of vertebrates and invertebrate prey, the venom proteomes of copperheads, cottonmouths, and cantils are remarkably similar, both in the type and relative abundance of their different toxin families. The venoms from all the eleven species and subspecies sampled showed relatively similar proteolytic and PLA2activities. In contrast, quantitative differences were observed in hemorrhagic and myotoxic activities in mice. The highest myotoxic activity was observed with the venoms of A. b. bilineatus, followed by A. p. piscivorus, whereas the venoms of A. c. contortrix and A. p. leucostoma induced the lowest myotoxic activity. The venoms of Agkistrodon bilineatus subspecies showed the highest hemorrhagic activity and A. c. contortrix the lowest. Compositional and toxicological analyses agree with clinical observations of envenomations by Agkistrodon in the USA and Central America. A comparative analysis of Agkistrodon shows that venom divergence tracks phylogeny of this genus to a greater extent than in Sistrurus rattlesnakes, suggesting that the distinct natural histories of Agkistrodon and Sistrurus clades may have played a key role in molding the patterns of evolution of their venom protein genes. Biological significance: A deep understanding of the structural and functional profiles of venoms and of the principles governing the evolution of venomous systems is a goal of venomics. Isolated proteomics analyses have been conducted on venoms from many species of vipers and pit vipers. However, making sense of these large inventories of data requires the integration of this information across multiple species to identify evolutionary and ecological trends. Our genus-wide venomics study provides a comprehensive overview of the toxic arsenal across Agkistrodon and a ground for understanding the natural histories of, and clinical observations of envenomations by, species of this genus. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The role of interspecific competition as a key factor in the ecology of natural communities where species exploit limited resources is well established, and the study of competition dynamics in snake communities has received much attention in recent years. Twenty years ago, an acclaimed review (Toft 1985) suggested that snakes were atypical among vertebrates because sympatric species usually partition the food niche. Here, I review the articles published in the last two decades with the aim of finding any general geographical or guild patterns and assessing if Toft's main conclusion is still supported by new evidence. Where appropriate, I use Monte Carlo simulations to establish whether observed patterns of niche overlap are real, or if they have occurred by chance. My study shows clear congruence in the patterns of coexistence exhibited by snake communities in different regions of the world, i.e.: (1) cold regions of the northern hemisphere (high latitudes and altitudes) exhibit low species richness and a very low, or even absent, potential for interspecific competition; (2) aquatic snakes that form communities in temperate regions generally partition the food type available and exhibit a broad similarity in habitat use with subtle differences in microhabitat use; (3) terrestrial snake communities in temperate regions are very variable in terms of their coexistence dynamics and show no evidence of generalised patterns; (4) sympatric viperids in Europe, North America and, most interestingly, tropical Asia partition the available habitat but not the prey resource; (5) competition is much stronger in tropical snake communities, and the intensity of this process fluctuates throughout the year being most intense during periods of low food availability; (6) in general, tropical snakes partition the food resource (prey type and/or prey size), but when this resource is not partitioned competitive exclusion can occur. Prey resource availability is a fundamental variable for all snake communities; this is clearly documented by studies on terrestrial snakes in Australia where, due to a relative scarcity of prey availability in the field, sympatry among species is much rarer than in other continents. I conclude that, although there are several notable exceptions, Toft's main conclusion is still supported by empirical evidence. However, I disagree with Toft's conclusion that most snakes are food specialists, and I contend that interspecific competition is important in structuring many (if not most) of the snake communities around the world.},
annote = {1) Is Toft's (1985) main conclusion (i.e. that snakes partition the food resource, and particularly the prey type) still valid?
2) Are there geographical patterns in the role that interspecific competition plays in organising snake communities? For instance, do snake communities follow the trend (Barbault 1987, 1991) to show higher levels of interspecific competition towards the tropics, and do the mechanisms of competition within snake communities also vary with latitude?
3) Can the patterns of resource use and interspecific competition in snakes be predicted on the basis of their guild? That is to say, at any given latitude, are the patterns of coexistence exhibited by sympatric aquatic snakes different from those of sympatric terrestrial or arboreal snakes?
4) Can we conclude that most communities of snakes around the world are governed by interspecific competition?

abstract = {Large-bodied mammalian herbivores dominated Earth's terrestrial ecosystems for several million years before undergoing substantial extinctions and declines during the Late Pleistocene (LP) due to prehistoric human impacts. The decline of large herbivores led to widespread ecological changes due to the loss of their ecological functions, as driven by their unique combinations of traits. However, recently, humans have significantly increased herbivore species richness through introductions in many parts of the world, potentially counteracting LP losses. Here, we assessed the extent to which introduced herbivore species restore lost—or contribute novel—functions relative to preextinction LP assemblages. We constructed multidimensional trait spaces using a trait database for all extant and extinct mammalian herbivores ≥10 kg known from the earliest LP (∼130,000 ybp) to the present day. Extinction-driven contractions of LP trait space have been offset through introductions by ∼39% globally. Analysis of trait space overlap reveals that assemblages with introduced species are overall more similar to those of the LP than native-only assemblages. This is because 64% of introduced species are more similar to extinct rather than extant species within their respective continents. Many introduced herbivores restore trait combinations that have the capacity to influence ecosystem processes, such as wildfire and shrub expansion in drylands. Although introduced species have long been a source of contention, our findings indicate that they may, in part, restore ecological functions reflective of the past several million years before widespread human-driven extinctions.},

abstract = {1. Fish in Mediterranean streams survive through the summer in residual surface waters, encompassing a broad range of abiotic and biotic conditions. Yet, the extent to which fish assemblages may be shaped by functional heterogeneity in dry-season refugia is largely unknown. This study addresses this issue, by examining fish assemblage and population attributes, and predation patterns in residual summer habitats (12 pools and six runs) across a Mediterranean catchment in south-west Portugal. 2. Species richness was fairly constant among runs but increased with pool size, with the addition of exotics and rare natives to large pools resulting in nested subsets. The four most common species (chub, nase, loach and eel) were considered generalists in terms of their use of dry-season refugia. Conversely, rare species presented more specialised habitats, with barbel and exotics favouring pools and stickleback favouring runs. 3. Age and size of the two most common species varied among dry-season habitats. Age 0 chub were restricted to runs, where spawning stages (age 2 and older fish) were also more represented. Age 0 nase also concentrated in runs, but the individuals collected in pools exhibited greater growth. Conversely, age 2 and older nase were proportionally more abundant in pools, but with greater growth and better condition in runs. 4. The otter was the main fish predator, consuming fish of all species and size classes, irrespective of habitat. Otter activity concentrated in pools, where predation risk for cyprinids seemed to be much higher than in runs. 5. Dry-season refugia apparently vary in functional importance for different fish species and life stages, acting as complementary units in the landscape. Therefore, the presence of both pool and run refugia trough the summer dry season may play a critical role in promoting the persistence of native species in Mediterranean streams.},

abstract = {Species that exhibit geographically defined phenotypic variation traditionally have been divided into subspecies. Subspecies based on phenotypic features may not comprise monophyletic groups due to selection, gene flow, and/or convergent evolution. In many taxonomic groups the number of species once designated as widespread is dwindling rapidly, and many workers reject the concept of subspecies altogether. We tested whether currently recognized subspecies in the plain-bellied watersnake Nerodia erythrogaster are concordant with relationships based on mitochondrial markers, and whether it represents a single widespread species. The range of this taxon spans multiple potential biogeographic barriers (especially the Mississippi and Apalachicola Rivers) that correspond with lineage breaks in many species, including other snakes. We sequenced three mitochondrial genes (NADH-II, Cyt-b, Cox-I) from 156 geo-referenced specimens and developed ecological niche models using Maxent and spatially explicit climate data to examine historical and ecological factors affecting variation in N. erythrogaster across its range. Overall, we found little support for the recognized subspecies as either independent evolutionary lineages or geographically circumscribed units and conclude that although some genetic and niche differentiation has occurred, most populations assigned to N. erythrogaster appear to represent a single, widespread species. However, additional sampling and application of nuclear markers are necessary to clarify the status of the easternmost populations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

When nitrate or nitrite ions were added to the water, some larvae of some species reduced feeding activity, swam less vigorously, showed disequilibrium and paralysis, suffered abnormalities and edemas, and eventually died. The observed effects increased with both concentration and time, and there were significant differences in sensitivity among species. Ambrystoma gracile displayed the highest acute effect in water with nitrate and nitrite. The three ranid species had acute effects in water with nitrite. In chronic exposures, R. pretiosa was the most sensitive species to nitrates and nitrites. All species showed 15-d LC50s lower than 2 mg N-NO2/L. For both N ions, B. boreas was the least sensitive amphibian. All species showed a high mortality at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-recommended limits of nitrite for warm-water fishes (5 mg N-NO2-/L) and a significant larval mortality at the recommended limits of nitrite concentration for drinking water (1 mg N-NO2-/L). The recommended levels of nitrate for warm-water fishes (90 mg NNO3-/L) were highly toxic for R. pretiosa and A. gracile larvae.},

We used radiotelemetry to document patterns of movement and macrohabitat selection of massasaugas in a fen environment, an important, but understudied, habitat. Based on both 100% minimum convex polygons and 95% kernel density, seasonal home ranges of males were larger than those of nongravid females which, in turn, were larger than those of gravid females. Activity center estimations followed the same trend as the seasonal range estimations. Similarly, activity centers (50% kernel density) of males were larger than those of nongravid females which were larger than those of gravid females. Nongravid females and gravid females differed in their mean frequency of daily movement, distance moved per day and total distance moved in a season. Males also differed from gravid females in these three regards, but only differed from nongravid females in distance moved per day. Compositional analysis of both 100% MCPs and 95% kernel densities indicated a preference for emergent wetland vegetation by all individuals; however, wooded areas and meadows were used to a lesser extent.},

Management actions that target the whole landscape or ecosystem may provide more cost-effective protection against the establishment of invasive species than a species-by-species approach. To explore what ecosystem-level actions might effectively reduce invasions, we developed a multispecies, multihabitat metapopulation model. We assume that species that successfully establish themselves outside their native range tend to be habitat generalists and that a tradeoff exists between competitive ability and habitat breadth, such that habitat specialists are competitively superior to habitat generalists. In this model, habitat destruction, fragmentation, and short-term disturbances all favor invasion by habitat generalists, despite the inferior competitive abilities of generalist species. Our model results illustrate that providing relatively undisturbed habitat and preventing further habitat degradation and fragmentation can provide a highly cost-effective defense against invasive species.},

abstract = {Ontogenetic niche shifts are common among animals, yet most studies only investigate niche shifts at the population level, which may overlook considerable differences among individuals in the timing and dynamics of these shifts. Such divergent behaviors within size-/age-classes have important implications for the roles a population—and specific age-classes—play in their respective ecosystem(s). Using acoustic telemetry, we tracked the movements of juvenile bull sharks in the Shark River Estuary of Everglades National Park, Florida, and found that sharks increased their use of marine microhabitats with age to take advantage of more abundant resources, but continued to use freshwater and estuarine microhabitats as refuges from marine predators. Within this population-level ontogenetic niche shift, however, movement patterns varied among individual sharks, with 47 % of sharks exhibiting condition-dependent habitat use and 53 % appearing risk-averse regardless of body condition. Among sharks older than age 0, fifty percent made regular movements between adjacent regions of the estuary, while the other half made less predictable movements that often featured long-term residence in specific regions. Individual differences were apparently shaped by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including individual responses to food-risk trade-offs and body condition. These differences appear to develop early in the lives of bull sharks, and persist throughout their residencies in nursery habitats. The widespread occurrence of intraspecific variation in behavior among mobile taxa suggests it is important in shaping population dynamics of at least some species, and elucidating the contexts and timing in which it develops and persists is important for understanding its role within communities.},

Habitat selection differs from use or association; it implies choice, and is commonly measured as use relative to avail-ability or as use versus non-use. Understanding habitat selection is more crucial than ever. Habitat loss is the pri-mary driver of species imperilment and extinction (Wilcove et al., 1998; Venter et al., 2006), and habitat protection is frequently incorporated into endangered species recov-ery planning and legislation. Examining habitat selection is one way to assess the importance of habitat to species conservation, but making such assessments is not always straightforward, even for well-studied species. We see 2 main obstructions to understanding habitat selection: First, the conceptual hurdles that obscure our knowledge of habi-tat selection and its underlying dynamics at multiple scales; and second, the practical limitations on sampling that stem, in part, from these conceptual issues. Habitat selection research is poised to overcome both the major conceptual obstacles and the practical sampling issues that have encumbered its progress. We suggest that the linkages among habitat selection, scale, and fitness},

abstract = {Intraspecific variability is increasingly recognized as an important component of foraging behavior that can have implications for both population and community dynamics. We used an individual-level approach to describe the foraging behavior of an abundant, generalist predator that inhabits a dynamic marine ecosystem, focusing specifically on the different foraging strategies used by individuals in the same demographic group. We collected data on movements and diving behavior of adult female California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) across multiple foraging trips to sea. Sea lions (n = 35) used one of three foraging strategies that primarily differed in their oceanic zone and dive depth: a shallow, epipelagic strategy, a mixed epipelagic/benthic strategy, and a deep-diving strategy. Individuals varied in their degree of fidelity to a given strategy, with 66 % of sea lions using only one strategy on all or most of their foraging trips across the two-month tracking period. All foraging strategies were present in each of the sampling years, but there were inter-annual differences in the population-level importance of each strategy that may reflect changes in prey availability. Deep-diving sea lions traveled shorter distances and spent a greater proportion of time at the rookery than sea lions using the other two strategies, which may have energetic and reproductive implications. These results highlight the importance of an individual-based approach in describing the foraging behavior of female California sea lions and understanding how they respond to the seasonal and annual changes in prey availability that characterize the California Current System.},

abstract = {The Prairie Pothole Region's myriad wetlands and small lakes contribute to its stature as the “duck factory” of North America. The fishless nature of the region's aquatic habitats, a result of frequent drying, freezing, and high salinity, influences its importance to waterfowl. Recent precipitation increases have resulted in higher water levels and wetland/lake freshening. In 2012–13, we sampled chemical characteristics and vertebrates (fish and salamanders) of 162 Prairie Pothole wetlands and small lakes. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling, principal component analysis, and bootstrapping techniques to reveal relationships. We found fish present in a majority of sites (84 %). Fish responses to water chemistry varied by species. Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and brook sticklebacks (Culaea inconstans) occurred across the broadest range of conditions. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) occurred in a smaller, chemically defined, subset. Iowa darters (Etheostoma exile) were restricted to the narrowest range of conditions. Tiger salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium) rarely occurred in lakes with fish. We also compared our chemical data to similar data collected in 1966–1976 to explore factors contributing to the expansion of fish into previously fishless sites. Our work contributes to a better understanding of relationships between aquatic biota and climate-induced changes in this ecologically important area.},

abstract = {Despite the increase of animal and plant introductions worldwide and the strong augmentation of the reptile trade, few invasive snake populations have been studied. Dice snakes (Natrix tessellata) were introduced to the shores of Lake Geneva (Switzerland) in the early 1920s, and are now well established. This region of introduction was previously inhabited by Viperine snakes (N. maura). Ever since these two species have been under monitoring (which began in 1996) the Viperine snake population has shown drastic decline.We examine here the possibility of trophic competition by analysing diet composition, prey size and trophic niche overlap. Spatial distribution is also assessed in order to address the question of spatial competitive exclusion. We found very similar diets, and thus a high trophic niche overlap, indicating no partitioning of the trophic resource. No arguments in favour of spatial competitive exclusion were found. Our study suggests that trophic competition may occur between the two natricines and that it may give an explanation for the drastic decline of the Viperine snake in this area. Other pathways potentially playing a role in the exclusion of the Viperine snake are discussed.},

abstract = {Molecular phylogenetic analyses of 26 of the 28 species of Ourisia, including eight of ten subspecies and two purported natural hybrids, are presented and used to examine the biogeography of the genus, which is distributed in subalpine to alpine habitats of South America, New Zealand and Tasmania. Gondwanan vicariance, often cited as the cause of this classic austral biogeographical pattern, was rejected by parametric bootstrapping of our combined dataset. Alternatively, various lines of evidence are presented in favour of a South American origin of Ourisia and subsequent dispersal to Australasia. Specifically, the genus likely arose in the Andes of central Chile and spread to southern Chile and Argentina, to the north-central Andes, and finally to Tasmania and New Zealand. The ancestor of the New Zealand species probably first arrived on the South Island, where the New Zealand species of Ourisia are most diverse, and migrated to the North and Stewart Islands. Because the Tasmanian and New Zealand species are sister to one another, the direction of dispersal between these two areas is equivocal. These results agree with other molecular phylogenetic studies that show that past dispersal between southern hemisphere continents has played an important role in the evolutionary history of many high-elevation austral plants. Our data also show that within South America, many of the geographical barriers (with the exception of the Atacama Desert) that have played a role in the evolution of other plant groups have not affected Ourisia species. Within New Zealand, the phylogeny and biogeography of species of Ourisia coincide with the geological history of the country and patterns of other alpine plants.

abstract = { Species distribution models (SDMs) have become an essential tool in ecology, biogeography, evolution and, more recently, in conservation biology. How to generalize species distributions in large undersampled areas, especially with few samples, is a fundamental issue of SDMs. In order to explore this issue, we used the best available presence records for the Hooded Crane ( Grus monacha , n  = 33), White-naped Crane ( Grus vipio , n  = 40), and Black-necked Crane ( Grus nigricollis , n  = 75) in China as three case studies, employing four powerful and commonly used machine learning algorithms to map the breeding distributions of the three species: TreeNet (Stochastic Gradient Boosting, Boosted Regression Tree Model), Random Forest, CART (Classification and Regression Tree) and Maxent (Maximum Entropy Models). In addition, we developed an ensemble forecast by averaging predicted probability of the above four models results. Commonly used model performance metrics (Area under ROC (AUC) and true skill statistic (TSS)) were employed to evaluate model accuracy. The latest satellite tracking data and compiled literature data were used as two independent testing datasets to confront model predictions. We found Random Forest demonstrated the best performance for the most assessment method, provided a better model fit to the testing data, and achieved better species range maps for each crane species in undersampled areas. Random Forest has been generally available for more than 20 years and has been known to perform extremely well in ecological predictions. However, while increasingly on the rise, its potential is still widely underused in conservation, (spatial) ecological applications and for inference. Our results show that it informs ecological and biogeographical theories as well as being suitable for conservation applications, specifically when the study area is undersampled. This method helps to save model-selection time and effort, and allows robust and rapid assessments and decisions for efficient conservation. },

abstract = {1. The relative extent of generalist or specialist resource use strategies is an important question in ecology. A community dominated by specialist strategies suggests a high level of interspecific competition for resources, resulting in the evolutionary development of isolating mechanisms between species (e.g. resource specialization to avoid and/or outcompete other species). A community dominated by generalist strategies suggests less interspecific competition for resources, allowing many taxa to utilize the same resources. In stream systems, generalist food habits are a common strategy among primary consumers, but little is known about resource assimilation strategies (resources incorporated into tissue growth). Published data indicate that generalist resource assimilation strategies may prevail in lotic systems as well. 2. Functional feeding groups (FFGs) are often used to infer resource assimilation among lotic macroinvertebrates (e.g. shredder-detritivore, scraper-herbivore). While these groupings are aptly used to describe invertebrate feeding modes and community structure, the use of FFGs to describe resource assimilation among lotic consumers is not appropriate. Sufficient data now exist to seriously question how accurately FFG assignments describe the processes of energy flow and material transfer between trophic levels in stream ecosystems. 3. Because FFGs may not accurately describe functional attributes in lotic systems, an alternative approach is needed. One approach is to determine the amount of secondary production that is derived from autochthonous (e.g. periphyton and algae) and allochthonous (e.g. detritus) resources directly. A simple model of community function based on this approach is presented. The model incorporates trophic generalists into measurement of consumer-resource energetics in lotic systems.},

However, the implications of road salt exposure for aquatic animal susceptibility to pathogens and parasites have not yet been examined even though infectious diseases can significantly contribute to wildlife population declines. Through a field survey, we found a range of NaCl concentrations (50–560 mg/L) in ponds known to contain larval amphibians, with lower levels found in sites close to gravel- rather than hard-surfaced roads. We then investigated how chronic exposure to environmentally-realistic levels of road salt (up to 1140 mg/L) affected susceptibility to infection by trematode parasites (helminths) in larval stages of two amphibian species (Lithobates sylvaticus − wood frogs, and L. pipiens − northern leopard frogs) by considering effects on host anti-parasite behavior and white blood cell profiles. Wood frogs exposed to road salt had higher parasite loads, and also exhibited reduced anti-parasite behavior in these conditions. In contrast, infection intensity in northern leopard frogs had a non-monotonic response to road salts even though lymphocytes were only elevated at the highest concentration. Our results indicate the potential for chronic road salt exposure to affect larval amphibian susceptibility to pathogenic parasites through alterations of behavior and immunocompetence, with further studies needed at higher concentrations, as well as that of road salts on free-living parasite infectious stages.},

These canids are predators of wildlife and domestic stock but dingoes are considered native and anecdotal reports suggest that they may suppress foxes such that dingo/dog conservation may have a net benefit to wildlife. This study examines dietary and spatial interactions between wild dogs and foxes in the Greater Blue Mountains region of NSW to address the possibility of suppression through competitive exclusion by dogs on foxes. Predator diets were compared using faecal analysis as well as an analysis of 19 dietary studies from similar forest habitats in eastern Australia. Spatial relationships were examined using data from an extensive canid control programme. Diets of wild dogs and foxes showed a high degree of overlap in species taken, indicating potential for competition. But there was also evidence of resource partitioning with the size and arboreality of mammalian prey differing between the two predators. Wild dogs and foxes responded to different landscape-scale variation in the physical environment, but there was no clear evidence of large-scale differences in their distribution. At the fine scale there was a negative association between these predators that indicated possible temporal avoidance or localized habitat shifts. Therefore, there is evidence for dietary competition and fine-scale exclusion, but no support for landscape-scale exclusion of foxes by wild dogs in the Blue Mountains.},

We tested habitat selection on three different scales: microhabitat (by modeling differences in climatic and structural variables between snake-selected sites and random sites, using logistic regression), macrohabitat, and landscape-scale (both by compositional analysis comparing proportions of habitat types used versus proportions available). One hundred percent minimum convex polygon (MCP) home ranges averaged 1.3 ha, and daily movement rates averaged 6.9 m/d. Models predicted that snakes exhibit complex microhabitat selection based on multiple climatic and structural variables including soil temperatures, relative humidity, canopy cover, litter depth, and various vegetation parameters. Snakes actively establish home ranges in the broader landscape by selecting areas with disproportionate quantities of emergent wetland, scrub/shrub wetland, and lowland hardwood habitats. Upland hardwood and all human-altered landscapes were rarely used, even though they were available. This has potentially serious conservation implications. Encroachment of these types of landscapes into areas of suitable habitat could severely restrict movement and home range sizes of these snakes. Potential disruption of movement patterns and gene flow of remaining populations could be extremely detrimental to this species.},

abstract = {Northern prairie wetlands play a vital role in the life cycle of a wide arrayof bird species. Prairie wetlands used by birds span the entire range from shallow ephemeralponds inundated for short periods each spring to large permanent water bodies that seldom,if ever, go dry. The objective of this study was to determine the response of blackbirds,waterfowl, and American Coots to changes in habitat structure induced by water levelfluctuations in prairie wetlands.The study was conducted on a series of experimental marshes within the Delta Marshin southern Manitoba, Canada. Water levels were adjusted following a predetermined sched-ule to simulate the wet–dry cycle of prairie marshes. Aerial photographs were taken an-nually, and habitats were characterized using Geographic Information System (GIS) tech-niques. Weekly avian censuses were related to habitat features using Principal ComponentsAnalysis (PCA) procedures.Yellow-headed Blackbirds selected shallowly flooded habitats with a mixture of openwater and emergent vegetation, while Red-winged Blackbirds were found in shallower areaswith dense vegetation. Coot habitat was consistent over the seasons. They preferred deep-water habitats with interspersed vegetation. As a group, dabbling ducks were generallyfound in hemi-marsh conditions (equal amounts of cover and water in an interspersedpattern) throughout much of the year. Some species moved to deeper, more open habitatsduring the fall season. As a group, diving ducks chose areas with deeper water and lessvegetation than dabbling ducks. However, there was considerable variation among divingduck species, with Canvasbacks using hemi-marsh sites in spring, and Ruddy Ducks andLesser Scaup using the most open sites found on the study areas.The wet–dry cycle characteristic of prairie marshes presents a wide array of habitatconditions for avian species. Although hemi-marsh conditions during the cycle result inmaximum use for a large number of species, they do not meet the requirements of allspecies in all seasons. Conservation programs should include wetland complexes of varyingwater depth and flooding duration to ensure the widest array of habitat types for avianspecies},

abstract = {A major objective of ecology is to understand how ecological processes limit population connectivity and species' distributions. By spatially quantifying ecological components driving functional connectivity, we can understand why some locally suitable habitats are unoccupied, resulting in observed discontinuities in distribution. However, estimating connectivity may be difficult due to population stochasticity and violations of assumptions of parametric statistics. To address these issues, we present a novel application of Random Forests to landscape genetic data. We address the effects of three key ecological components on Bufo boreas connectivity in Yellowstone National Park: ecological process, scale, and hierarchical organization. Habitat permeability, topographic morphology, and temperature-moisture regime are all significant ecological processes associated with B. boreas connectivity. Connectivity was influenced by growing-season precipitation, 1988 Yellowstone fires, cover, temperature, impervious surfaces (roads and development), and topographic complexity (56% variation explained). We found that habitat permeability generally operates on fine scales, while topographic morphology and temperature-moisture regime operate across multiple scales, thus demonstrating the importance of cross-scale analysis for ecological interpretation. In a hierarchical analysis, we were able to explain more variation within genetic clusters as identified using Structure (a Bayesian algorithm) (74%; dispersal cover, growingseason precipitation, impervious surfaces) as opposed to between genetic clusters (45%; ridgelines, hot, dry slopes, length of hot season, and annual precipitation). Finally, the analytical methods we developed are powerful and can be applied to any species or system with appropriate landscape and genetic data. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

In North America, international treaties mandate a primary objective of protecting migratory bird populations, with a secondary objective of providing hunting opportunity in a manner compatible with such protection. Through the years, annual establishment of hunting regulations and acquisition and management of habitat have been the primary management actions taken by federal agencies. Various information-gathering programs were established and, by the 1960s, had developed into arguably the best monitoring system in the world for continentally distributed animal populations. Retrospective analyses using estimates from this monitoring system have been used to investigate effects of management actions on waterfowl population and harvest dynamics, but key relationships are still characterized by uncertainty. We recommend actively adaptive management as an approach that can meet short-term harvest objectives, while reducing uncertainty and ensuring sustainable populations over the long-term.},

Ecological niche partitioning is a means of reducing direct competition between coexisting species and differences in habitat use among island gecko species have been suggested as a by-product of specialization to feeding on certain resources. Here, we examine modes and drivers of niche partitioning of two endemic species of Phelsuma gecko (Phelsuma sundbergi and Phelsuma astriata) in relict native palm forest in the Seychelles to further understanding of congeneric reptile co-existence in native habitats. Phelsuma abundance, microhabitat use and habitat composition were quantified in different macrohabitat types. P. sundbergi showed a clear preference for habitat dominated by the coco de mer palm, Lodoicea maldivica and a strong association with male individuals of this dioecious species. P. astriata density increased significantly with arboreal biodiversity but did not display a relationship with a specific tree type. High levels of resource segregation were determined along the microhabitat axis, based on differential tree preference. Our results suggest that P. sundbergi and P. astriata may have evolved to co-exist in this habitat type through partitioning of microhabitat as members of a divergent specialist/generalist assemblage determined by consumption of L. maldivica pollen by P. sundbergi. Our findings concur with the hypothesis that differences in habitat use among island reptiles are a by-product of trophic specialization and support the conservation of native habitat for maintenance of reptile diversity.},

In the southwestern deserts of North America, anecdotal evidence suggests provisioning birds with food and water attracts rattlesnakes to exurban yards, either indirectly by increasing prey availability or directly through attraction to water. We conducted the first experimental test of this hypothesis by providing bird seed, water, or bird seed and water at 2 national monuments in Arizona, USA, and followed the responses of adult western diamond-backed rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) equipped with radio-transmitters, and endothermic prey species, primarily rodents, birds, and lagomorphs. We found differing responses among prey taxa to supplemental food and water provisioning: rodents showed no response to any treatment, birds responded to food treatments, and lagomorphs responded to water treatments. Overall, spatial responses by adult rattlesnakes were weak, but several subjects appeared to respond to individual treatment grids. We did not find evidence of a direct response by rattlesnakes to supplemental water. Overall, we found little support for the prevalent belief that food and water sources at provisioning stations increase local concentrations of rattlesnakes; we provide several explanations for this counter-intuitive result. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

Over time, only mixed prairie dabbling ducks showed changes in diversity in agreement with the hypothesis; ie diversity changed owing to changes in evenness in the more rigorous environment.

However, using published taxonomic diet lists for seven species of ducks, measurements of bill morphology form museum specimens, and "handbook" data on the sizes and calorie density of invertebrates, prey size distributions were found to differ among species. Also, the sizes of prey in each species' diet differed from that found in the environment. The number of lamellae per centimeter of bill negatively correlated with mean prey size (P< 0.001): body size and bill length did not. Based on the similarity of environmental and dietary prey size distributions, species were classified as specialist or generalist foragers. This classification corresponded well with one generated from analyses of foraging behavior alone. An explanation for the diminutive sizes of ducks along a prey size niche dimension, then in the absence of competition from small species on islands, large solitary species have evolved to a smaller size which may be optimal for the distribution of energy among prey size classes in the environment.},

Our analyses included: mRNA levels of dmrt1, cyp17, amh, cyp19, foxl2 and ar (tadpoles/metamorphs), gonadal histomorphology (metamorphs/adults), mRNA levels of ar/gr (adult male brain/gonad/forelimb), testosterone/corticosterone levels (adult males), secondary sexual characteristics (forelimb width/nuptial pad: adult males) and breeding competence (amplexus/fertility: adult males). Compared to controls, feminised sex ratios and increased number of spermatogonia (adults) were observed after exposure to flutamide and the lower linuron concentration. Exposure to the lower linuron concentration also resulted in demasculinisation of secondary sexual characteristics and reduced male fertility. Flutamide exposure resulted in masculinisation of the nuptial pad and elevated mRNA levels of dmrt1, cyp17, amh and foxl2 in brains (metamorphs). Testosterone levels were higher in all treatment groups, however, overall few effects were observed in response to the higher linuron concentration.

abstract = {Climate-driven variability of habitat selection of large herbivores has not yet been explicitly analyzed. To this end, we aimed to better understand the climate-ecological mechanisms behind geographic patterns of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) habitat utilization. Our study area comprised of the ranges of Filefjell Reinlag, southern Norway (60°20′-61°20′ N; 8°20′-9°50′ E). We analyzed habitat selection of 20 (±2) GPS-collared female reindeer over a period of five years. We examined the mechanistic forces of habitat selection variability by applying a novel stepwise factor analysis approach based on the niche concept. We characterized the governing conditions for inductively delineated seasons and extracted in a first step for each year the seasonal scores of the individual animals on the environmental variables to explain their habitat use. For each season, we then conducted principal component analyses (PCA) to analyze the inter-annual variability in habitat preferences using the individual scores for the environmental variables per year. In a third step, we fit our potential drivers as vectors onto each seasonal PCA and retained solely significant drivers. Our results reveal complex spatiotemporal patterns of habitat selection that are driven by seasonality, year-to-year climate variability, and the choice of individual animals. In contrast to expected similarities between conspecifics, our analyses revealed varying degrees of intraspecies variability and therefore suggest that responses of individual reindeer to climate variability are inconsistent. Moreover, we found annually reoccurring patterns of habitat selection strength during different seasons that help explain coping capacities of reindeer against climate variability. In contrast with our expectations, we detected a very high inter-annual variability in habitat preferences to be related to governing climatic conditions. Here, we present new evidence for the variability of response mechanisms of reindeer's habitat selection shown throughout different seasons and years that buffer alpine pastoralism against climate variability. Our work contributes to a better understanding of alpine ecological response mechanisms as a key for projections of future responses to climate change.},

This review summarizes our current understanding of vertebrate community composition at seasonal forest pools in the northeastern United States. These wetlands typically have hydroperiods that range from temporarily flooded to intermittently exposed, which reduces densities of many potential predators (e.g., fish). Current research has shown that pool hydroperiod, canopy closure, vegetation structure within pools, presence of potential predators, and landscape structure surrounding pools are the key factors determining vertebrate diversity at seasonal forest pools. Of 25 species of amphibians in the region, frogs (10 of 12 species) are more likely to breed in seasonal forest pools than salamanders (6 of 13 species). Seven of 10 amphibian species that breed in seasonal forest pools are state-listed as threatened or endangered. Among 27 species of reptiles, 3 of 15 species of snakes, and 6 of 12 species of turtles utilize seasonal pools during at least one stage of their annual cycle. Seasonal forest pools are important foraging and basking habitat for three species of turtles listed as threatened or endangered. Compared to other vertebrate taxa, most species of mammals are habitat generalists, with 50 of 63 mammal species potentially foraging at seasonal pools during part of their annual cycle. Chiroptera (bats; all 9 species) are believed to actively forage at seasonal pools and some Insectivora, particularly Sorex palustris Richardson and S. fumeus (Miller) and Condylura cristata (L.), are detected regularly at seasonal pools. Breeding birds are less likely to utilize seasonal pools than other vertebrate taxa, although 92 of 233 species might forage or breed near seasonal pools. Several species of Anatidae, Rallidae, and some Passeriformes use seasonally flooded pools. All vertebrates that use seasonal forest pools use other habitats during some stage in their life cycle; thus gaining a clear understanding of their habitat requirements is critical to their long-term persistence. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {Sexual dimorphism is usually interpreted in terms of reproductive adaptations, but the degree of sex divergence also may be affected by sex-based niche partitioning. In gape-limited animals like snakes, the degree of sexual dimorphism in body size (SSD) or relative head size can determine the size spectrum of ingestible prey for each sex. Our studies of one mainland and four insular Western Australian populations of carpet pythons (Morelia spilota) reveal remarkable geographical variation in SSD, associated with differences in prey resources available to the snakes. In all five populations, females grew larger than males and had larger heads relative to body length. However, the populations differed in mean body sizes and relative head sizes, as well as in the degree of sexual dimorphism in these traits. Adult males and females also diverged strongly in dietary composition: males consumed small prey (lizards, mice and small birds), while females took larger mammals such as possums and wallabies. Geographic differences in the availability of large mammalian prey were linked to differences in mean adult body sizes of females (the larger sex) and thus contributed to sex-based resource partitioning. For example, in one population adult male snakes ate mice and adult females ate wallabies; in another, birds and lizards were important prey types for both sexes. Thus, the high degree of geographical variation among python populations in sexually dimorphic aspects of body size and shape plausibly results from geographical variation in prey availability. {\textcopyright} 2002 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract = {Principal component analysis is one of the most widely applied tools in order to summarize common patterns of variation among variables. Several studies have investigated the ability of individual methods, or compared the performance of a number of methods, in determining the number of components describing common variance of simulated data sets. We identify a number of shortcomings related to these studies and conduct an extensive simulation study where we compare a larger number of rules available and develop some new methods. In total we compare 20 stopping rules and propose a two-step approach that appears to be highly effective. First, a Bartlett's test is used to test the significance of the first principal component, indicating whether or not at least two variables share common variation in the entire data set. If significant, a number of different rules can be applied to estimate the number of non-trivial components to be retained. However, the relative merits of these methods depend on whether data contain strongly correlated or uncorrelated variables. We also estimate the number of non-trivial components for a number of field data sets so that we can evaluate the applicability of our conclusions based on simulated data. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most commonly used tools in the analysis of ecological data. This method reduces the effective dimensionality of a multivariate data set by producing linear combinations of the original variables (i.e., components) that summarize the predominant patterns in the data. In order to provide meaningful interpretations for principal components, it is important to determine which variables are associated with particular components. Some data analysts incorrectly test the statistical significance of the correlation between original variables and multivariate scores using standard statistical tables. Others interpret eigenvector coefficients larger than an arbitrary absolute value (e.g., 0.50). Resampling, randomization techniques, and parallel analysis have been applied in a few cases. In this study, we compared the performance of a variety of approaches for assessing the significance of eigenvector coefficients in terms of type I error rates and power. Two novel approaches based on the broken-stick model were also evaluated. We used a variety of simulated scenarios to examine the influence of the number of real dimensions in the data; unique versus complex variables; the magnitude of eigenvector coefficients; and the number of variables associated with a particular dimension. Our results revealed that bootstrap confidence intervals and a modified bootstrap confidence interval for the broken-stick model proved to be the most reliable techniques.},

abstract = {Widespread niche convergence suggests that species can be organized according to functional trait combinations to create a framework analogous to a periodic table. We compiled ecological data for lizards to examine patterns of global and regional niche diversification, and we used multivariate statistical approaches to develop the beginnings for a periodic table of niches. Data (501 variables) for five major niche dimensions (habitat, diet, life history, metabolism, defense) were compiled for 134 species of lizards representing 24 of the 38 extant families. Principal coordinates analyses were performed on niche dimensional data sets, and species scores for the first three axes were used as input for a principal components analysis to ordinate species in continuous niche space and for a regression tree analysis to separate species into discrete niche categories. Three-dimensional models facilitate exploration of species positions in relation to major gradients within the niche hypervolume. The first gradient loads on body size, foraging mode, and clutch size. The second was influenced by metabolism and terrestrial versus arboreal microhabitat. The third was influenced by activity time, life history, and diet. Natural dichotomies are activity time, foraging mode, parity mode, and habitat. Regression tree analysis identified 103 cases of extreme niche conservatism within clades and 100 convergences between clades. Extending this approach to other taxa should lead to a wider understanding of niche evolution.},

abstract = {There is currently little evidence of pollution-induced endocrine dysfunction in amphibia, in spite of widespread concern over global declines in this ecologically diverse group. Data regarding the potential effects of endocrine-disrupting contaminants (EDCs) on reproductive function in amphibia are particularly lacking. We hypothesized that estrogenic EDCs may disrupt progesterone-induced oocyte maturation in the adult amphibian ovary, and tested this with an in vitro germinal vesicle breakdown assay using defolliculated oocytes from the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. While a variety of natural and synthetic estrogens and xenoestrogens were inactive in this system, the proestrogenic pesticide methoxychlor was a surprisingly potent inhibitor of progesterone-induced oocyte maturation (median inhibitive concentration, 72 nM). This inhibitory activity was specific to methoxychlor, rather than to its estrogenic contaminants or metabolites, and was not antagonized by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780, suggesting that this activity is not estrogenic per se. The inhibitory activity of methoxychlor was dose dependent, reversible, and early acting. However, washout was unable to reverse the effect of short methoxychlor exposure, and methoxychlor did not competitively displace [3H]progesterone from a specific binding site in the oocyte plasma membrane. Therefore, methoxychlor may exert its action not directly at the site of progesterone action, but downstream on early events in maturational signaling, although the precise mechanism of action is unclear. The activity of methoxychlor in this system indicates that xenobiotics may exert endocrine-disrupting effects through interference with progestin-regulated processes and through mechanisms other than receptor antagonism.},

We trapped and radio-collared 15 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and 14 coyotes (Canis latrans) in the urban landscape of Madison, Wisconsin, to determine the prevalence of disease among these canids and to examine how these canids were using the landscape. Using Fisher's exact probability tests, we found that coyotes had a significantly higher seroprevalence of Lyme disease (P = 0.002) and a higher prevalence of canine heartworm disease (P = 0.02) than foxes. Red foxes did not select specific habitat types in the urban landscape, but coyotes selected for forest and grass cover types, and avoided developed sites. Understanding the prevalence of disease in urban canid populations is important because diseases affecting urban canids cause morbidity and mortality and are transmissible to domestic dogs, and vice versa. Additionally, urban canids may serve as sentinels for zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease and leptospirosis.},

abstract = {In an effort to develop quantitative relationships between various kinds of flow alteration and ecological responses, we reviewed 165 papers published over the last four decades, with a focus on more recent papers. Our aim was to determine if general relationships could be drawn from disparate case studies in the literature that might inform environmental flows science and management. For all 165 papers we characterised flow alteration in terms of magnitude, frequency, duration, timing and rate of change as reported by the individual studies. Ecological responses were characterised according to taxonomic identity (macroinvertebrates, fish, riparian vegetation) and type of response (abundance, diversity, demographic parameters). A 'qualitative' or narrative of the reported results strongly corroborated previous, less comprehensive, reviews by documenting strong and variable ecological responses to all types of flow alteration. Of the 165 papers, 152 (92%) reported decreased values for recorded ecological metrics in response to a variety of types of flow alteration, whereas 21 papers (13%) reported increased values. Fifty-five papers had information suitable for quantitative analysis of ecological response to flow alteration. Seventy per cent of these papers reported on alteration in flow magnitude, yielding a total of 65 data points suitable for analysis. The quantitative analysis provided some insight into the relative sensitivities of different ecological groups to alteration in flow magnitudes, but robust statistical relationships were not supported. Macroinvertebrates showed mixed responses to changes in flow magnitude, with abundance and diversity both increasing and decreasing in response to elevated flows and to reduced flows. Fish abundance, diversity and demographic rates consistently declined in response to both elevated and reduced flow magnitude. Riparian vegetation metrics both increased and decreased in response to reduced peak flows, with increases reflecting mostly enhanced non-woody vegetative cover or encroachment into the stream channel. Our analyses do not support the use of the existing global literature to develop general, transferable quantitative relationships between flow alteration and ecological response; however, they do support the inference that flow alteration is associated with ecological change and that the risk of ecological change increases with increasing magnitude of flow alteration. New sampling programs and analyses that target sites across well-defined gradients of flow alteration are needed to quantify ecological response and develop robust and general flow alteration-ecological response relationships. Similarly, the collection of pre- and post-alteration data for new water development programs would significantly add to our basic understanding of ecological responses to flow alteration. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that direct mortality and physiological effects caused by pollutants are major contributing factors to global amphibian decline. However, even sublethal concentrations of pollutants could be harmful if they combined with other factors to cause high mortality in amphibians. Here we show that sublethal concentrations of pollutants can disrupt the ability of amphibian larvae to recognize predators, hence increasing their risk of predation. This effect is indeed much more important since very low amounts of pollutants are ubiquitous, and environmental efforts are mostly directed towards preventing lethal spills. We analyzed the effects of two common contaminants (humic acid and ammonium nitrate) on the ability of tadpoles of the western spadefoot toad (Pelobates cultripes) to recognize chemical cues from a common predator, nymphs of the dragonfly Anax imperator. We compared the swimming activity of tadpoles in the presence and absence of water-borne chemical cues from dragonflies at different concentrations of humic acid and ammonium nitrate. Tadpoles reduced swimming activity in response to predator cues in the absence of pollutants, whereas they remained unresponsive to these cues when either humic acid or ammonium nitrate was added to the water, even at low concentrations. Moreover, changes in tadpole activity associated with the pollutants themselves were non-significant, indicating no toxic effect. Alteration of the natural chemical environment of aquatic systems by pollutants may be an important contributing cause for declines in amphibian populations, even at sublethal concentrations.},

abstract = {Suitable over-wintering habitat is critical to the survival of snake populations at higher latitudes. The identification and protection of traditional, communal hibernation sites (hibernacula) is important for the conservation of threatened species, while the assessment of hibernacula availability may help determine the extent to which population distributions are limited by habitat suitability. In this paper, we quantified surface habitat characteristics of 10 hibernacula and the composition of basking trees used by a threatened population of black rat snakes (Elaphe o. obsoleta) at the northern limit of the species' range. Hibernacula were typically situated on relatively rocky, south-facing slopes. The co-occurrence of these features was sufficiently unique as to distinguish hibernacula from (1) a series of random sites, but not from (2) a set of intuitively identified "potential hibernacula" in the surrounding landscape. This implies that additional requisite elements (e.g., underground structure and micro-climatic conditions), which we were unable to quantify, set actual hibernacula apart from sites that appear to be otherwise suitable (i.e., "potential hibernacula"). Basking trees found at hibernacula tended to be relatively large and decayed or dying with numerous cavities. Unused trees exhibiting these characteristics were also available at both random sites and potential hibernacula indicating the suitability of those sites for basking. Our results suggest that rat snake hibernacula cannot be predictably located by simply searching for key surface habitat features in the landscape. The current data are equivocal as to whether or not this most northern population is limited by the availability of suitable over-winter habitat since the possibility that essential subterranean features of hibernacula are limiting remains to be tested.},

It was identified that there may not be a correlation of surface charecteristics to identification of a communal hibernaculum. 

However percent rock, degree of slope, and aspect play some roles.

Possible characteristics for a communal hibernaculum are 
1) structurally stable
2) Deep enough that the snakes do not reach fatal temps.
3) Sufficiently humid to preclude over-winter dehydration.},

abstract = {We expect moral behaviour from scientists. Morality implies being a good person and being good at one's profession. The general view appears to be that the vast majority of scientists aim to achieve these high standards.Science prides itself on the 'self-correcting' mechanism in the scientific method, namely the requirement to reproduce findings before they are taken seriously. However, when findings are related to the adverse effects of chemicals there are several features that make this less effective than in some other fields of science. First, is the perception that everyone is exposed to chemicals and observations about chemical danger are immediately applicable to many people. Second, it is often easy to summarize adverse findings in attention-getting headlines seen by the lay public before the slow process of replication and interpretation has time to work. Third, most regulatory toxicology studies on a particular compound are only done once to minimise cost and the use of animals. Finally, the question posed about chemicals - are they safe? - is easy to ask but more difficult to test with appropriate studies.Fabrication of data in regulatory studies was found to occur in several contract laboratories in the 1960s and this lead directly to the introduction of Good Laboratory Practice regulations. Now studies submitted for regulatory purposes must comply with GLP regulations and this has virtually eliminated flawed studies due to fraudulent or careless behaviour.It is possible to discern different ways in which the expected standards have not been met. The first is in the intention of the work. Thus reports that the Roodeplaats Research Laboratory in South Africa was seeking to identify toxins that would kill without trace is an example where the intention is unacceptable. The second is in the conduct of the studies. Here the examples of William McBride and Michael Briggs who falsified data are pertinent. The example of the retraction of reports on the toxicity of ecstasy because the wrong compound had been administered indicates a degree of carelessness in the conduct of the study. The third is in the design and interpretation of studies. The report that genetic modification per se could render potatoes toxic has been criticised because of the inappropriate design and interpretation of the studies. Finally, that the reports of studies are biased because of conflicts of interest. Journals often require a declaration that the author has no financial conflict of interest. However, there are many other conflicts of interest with just as large an impact on the author's impartiality which are omitted from consideration. Gamesmanship has also entered the practice of toxicology, for example where strong assertions about conflict of interest are used to justify particular points of view.The main casualty from fraud, errors and gamesmanship is the perceived status of science itself. It is only gamesmanship that is on the increase. The remedies for these activities are explored. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The use of pesticides is important for growing crops and protecting human health by reducing the prevalence of targeted pest species. However, less attention is given to the potential unintended effects on nontarget species, including taxonomic groups that are of current conservation concern. One issue raised in recent years is the potential for pesticides to become more lethal in the presence of predatory cues, a phenomenon observed thus far only in the laboratory. A second issue is whether pesticides can induce unintended trait changes in nontarget species, particularly trait changes that might mimic adaptive responses to natural environmental stressors. Using outdoor mesocosms, I created simple wetland communities containing leaf litter, algae, zooplankton, and three species of tadpoles (wood frogs [Rana sylvatica or Lithobates sylvaticus], leopard frogs [R. pipiens or L. pipiens], and American toads [Bufo americanus or Anaxyrus americanus]). I exposed the communities to a factorial combination of environmentally relevant herbicide concentrations (0, 1, 2, or 3 mg acid equivalents [a.e.]/L of Roundup Original MAX) crossed with three predator-cue treatments (no predators, adult newts [Notophthalmus viridescens], or larval dragonflies [Anax junius]). Without predator cues, mortality rates from Roundup were consistent with past studies. Combined with cues from the most risky predator (i.e., dragonflies), Roundup became less lethal (in direct contrast to past laboratory studies). This reduction in mortality was likely caused by the herbicide stratifying in the water column and predator cues scaring the tadpoles down to the benthos where herbicide concentrations were lower. Even more striking was the discovery that Roundup induced morphological changes in the tadpoles. In wood frog and leopard frog tadpoles, Roundup induced relatively deeper tails in the same direction and of the same magnitude as the adaptive changes induced by dragonfly cues. To my knowledge, this is the first study to show that a pesticide can induce morphological changes in a vertebrate. Moreover, the data suggest that the herbicide might be activating the tadpoles' developmental pathways used for antipredator responses. Collectively, these discoveries suggest that the world's most widely applied herbicide may have much further-reaching effects on nontarget species than previous considered. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Amphibian richness was compared to wetland size, vegetation classes, presence of bullfrog and fish predators, hydrologic characteristics of water flow, fluctuation, and permanence, and land use. Low velocity flow and low fluctuation were correlated with high species richness. Seasonal persistence of water was unrelated to species richness. Wetland size, distance to other wetlands favorable for breeding, fish and bullfrog predators, and the number of vegetation classes found at a wetland were unrelated to total number of species. Increasing mean water-level fluctuation and percent watershed urbanization were correlated with low species richness. Small and structurally simple wetlands often have high value amphibian habitat, and traditional reliance on wetland size and broad vegetation classes without site-specific studies should be avoided when assessing habitat value for amphibians. {\textcopyright} 1995 Society of Wetland Scientists.},

Black ducks preferred persistent emergent, broad-leaved deciduous forested, and broad-leaved deciduous scrub-shrub wetlands over unconsolidated organic bottom, needle-leaved evergreen forested, and broad-leaved evergreen scrub-shrub ponds. Birds also made frequent use of small ephemeral pools and streams throughout the breeding period. Nests were located in several habitats ranging from wetland sites to upland areas 1.5 km from the most frequently used pond. Home range size averaged 1 19 ha for females and 23 1 ha for males and did not differ by reproductive stage. Three pairs used only a single pond during the incubation period. Home ranges were linear (linearity index = 2.8), averaging 1956 m long for females and 2755 m for males. Wetlands used most by hens during incubation recesses were not always those located closest to the nest. Radio-marked ducks that returned in subsequent breeding seasons demonstrated fidelity to the previously used home range. Pair bonds of marked birds lasted until day 19 or 20 of incubation for initial nesting attempts.},

Allen's rule maintains that endothermic species from cool environments should have shorter extremities than their counterparts from warm areas. Although a number of studies have supported both rules, the validity of these trends remains controversial, especially for ectothermic organisms. Here, we studied intraspecific morphological variation in Four-Eyed Frogs (Pleurodema thaul) to determine if these rules are valid in an ecogeographic context. Specifically, we analyzed how morphology varies across nine traits in males of P. thaul collected from nine localities in Chile. A discriminant analysis of all measured traits indicated differentiation between localities, and the first two canonical variables explained ∼80% of the total variation in morphometric features. Additionally, these two canonical variables were correlated with precipitation and monthly minimum temperature. To...},

From 1349 random transects through a marsh we found that basking activity peaked at 09:00 and then declined steadily until 14:00 before increasing again. Our ability to detect snakes depended upon the microhabitat they occupied, and to the time of day when the snakes were encountered in water. In the field, temperatures of basking snakes averaged ( plus or minus SE) 26.3 plus or minus 0.7 degree C (n = 36), while captive snakes in a thermal gradient showed a narrower selectivity, averaging 27.7 plus or minus 0.4 degree C (n = 21). The temperatures of basking snakes never exceeded 33 degree C, even though a model snake placed in the sun reached 48 degree C, suggesting that the snakes were thermoregulating to prevent overheating. In both the field and enclosures, water snakes basked more frequently as the temperature of the air increased relative to the water. Experimental manipulation of water temperature relative to air temperature revealed that temperature influenced microhabitat selection independently of circadian patterns},

Nerodia erythrogaster neglecta used twice as many wetlands (4.1 +/- 0.4) as N. s. sipedon (2.1 +/- 0.3), moved between these wetlands three times more often (9.1 +/- 1.9 times) than N. s. sipedon (2.8 +/- 1.0 times), and moved to small wetlands seven times more often (3.6 +/- 0.7 times) than N. s. sipedon (0.5 +/- 0.3 times). Nearly 30% of N. e. neglecta locations were in uplands, sometimes over 100 m from the nearest wetland. Less than 3% of N. s. sipedon locations were in upland habitats, and all locations were < 30 m from wetlands. We simulated the impact of small wetland loss and demonstrated that N. e. neglecta would need to move longer than normal distances when traveling between wetlands after small wetlands are lost, while N. s. sipedon would not. The northernmost populations of N. e. neglecta are listed as federally threatened and state endangered in Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana; N. s. sipedon remains abundant in this region. Historic and current wetland losses in the midwestern United States may have severely impacted N. e. neglecta populations due to this species' high vagility and use of numerous wetlands.

We conducted a comparative radiotelemetry study of two snake species, the northern water snake, Nerodia sipedon sipedon, and the imperiled copperbelly water snake, Nerodia erythrogaster neglecta, in northwest Ohio and southern Michigan to assess differences in movement patterns, spatial ecology, and resource use. N. e. neglecta moved distances (53.3±7.1 m/day and 4809±603 m/year) over twice as far as N. s. sipedon (25.6±2.7 m/day and 2244±228 m/year), and used areas nearly four times larger (15.8±2.7 ha) than N. s. sipedon (4.0±0.9 ha). When wetlands were widely dispersed in the landscape, N. e. neglecta moved longer distances and used larger areas, whereas spatial and movement patterns in N. s. sipedon were unaffected by wetland spatial distribution. N. e. neglecta's long movements and large area use are likely related to its use of variable resources such as ephemeral wetlands and anuran prey. N. s. sipedon used more permanent wetlands and preyed more generally on fish and anurans. Habitat alterations that change the spatial distribution of wetlands in the landscape, such as the loss of small isolated wetlands, have likely increased energetic costs and mortality rates for N. e. neglecta. Conservation strategies for vagile wetland animals that use spatially and temporally variable resources over broad spatial scales should focus on protecting and restoring large areas with numerous, heterogeneous wetlands. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used to project the potential distribution of introduced species outside their native range. Such studies rarely explicitly evaluate potential conflicts with native species should the range of introduced species expand. Two snake species native to eastern North America, Nerodia fasciata and Nerodia sipedon, have been introduced to California where they represent a new stressor to declining native amphibians, fish, and reptiles. To project the potential distributions of these non-native watersnakes in western North America, we built ensemble SDMs using MaxEnt, Boosted Regression Trees, and Random Forests and habitat and climatic variables. We then compared the overlap between the projected distribution of invasive watersnakes and the distributions of imperiled native amphibians, fish, and reptiles that can serve as prey or competitors for the invaders, to estimate the risk to native species posed by nonnative watersnakes. Large areas of western North America were projected to be climatically suitable for both species of Nerodia according to our ensemble SDMs, including much of central California. The potential distributions of both N. fasciata and N. sipedon overlap extensively with the federally threatened Giant Gartersnake, Thamnophis gigas, which inhabits a similar ecological niche. N. fasciata also poses risk to the federally threatened California Tiger Salamander, Ambystoma californiense, whereas N. sipedon poses risk to some amphibians of conservation concern, including the Foothill Yellow-legged Frog, Rana boylii . We conclude that non-native watersnakes in California can likely inhabit ranges of several native species of conservation concern that are expected to suffer as prey or competing species for these invaders. Action should be taken now to eradicate or control these invasions before detrimental impacts on native species are widespread. Our methods can be applied broadly to quantify the risk posed by incipient invasions to native biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Rose, Todd.},

abstract = {Highly mobile top predators are hypothesized to spatially and/or temporally link disparate habitats through the combination of their movement and feeding patterns, but recent studies suggest that individual specialization in habitat use and feeding could keep habitats compartmentalized. We used passive acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analysis to investigate whether specialization in movement and feeding patterns of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) in an oligotrophic subtropical estuary created habitat linkages between marine and estuarine/freshwater food webs. Individual alligators adopted one of the three relatively distinct movement tactics that were linked to variation in diets. Fifty-six per cent of alligators regularly travelled from the upstream (freshwater/mid-estuary) areas into the downstream (marine-influenced) areas where salinities exceed those typically tolerated by alligators. Thirty-one per cent of the alligators made regular trips from the mid-estuarine habitat into the upstream habitat; 13% remained in the mid-estuary zone year-round. Stable isotopic analysis indicated that, unlike individuals remaining in the mid-estuary and upstream zones, alligators that used the downstream zone fed at least partially from marine food webs and likely moved to access higher prey abundance at the expense of salt stress. Therefore, 'commuting' alligators may link marine food webs with those of the estuary and marshes in the coastal Everglades and create an upstream vector for allochthonous nutrient inputs into the estuary. This study lends further support to the hypothesis that large-bodied highly mobile predators faced with trade-offs are likely to exhibit individual specialization leading to habitat linkages, rather than compartmentalization. However, the conditions under which this scenario occurs require further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Movement and habitat use patterns are fundamental components of the behaviors of mobile animals and help determine the scale and types of interactions they have with their environments. These behaviors are especially important to quantify for top predators because they can have strong effects on lower trophic levels as well as the wider ecosystem. Many studies of top predator movement and habitat use focus on general population level trends, which may overlook important intra-population variation in behaviors that now appear to be common. In an effort to better understand the prevalence of intra-population variation in top predator movement behaviors and the potential effects of such variation on ecosystem dynamics, we examined the movement and habitat use patterns of a population of adult American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) in a subtropical estuary for nearly four years. We found that alligators exhibited divergent behaviors with respect to activity ranges, movement rates, and habitat use, and that individualized behaviors were stable over multiple years. We also found that the variations across the three behavioral metrics were correlated such that consistent behavioral types emerged, specifically more exploratory individuals and more sedentary individuals. Our study demonstrates that top predator populations can be characterized by high degrees of intra-population variation in terms of movement and habitat use behaviors that could lead to individuals filling different ecological roles in the same ecosystem. By extension, one-size-fits-all ecosystem and species-specific conservation and management strategies that do not account for potential intra-population variation in top predator behaviors may not produce the desired outcomes in all cases. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Individual niche specialization (INS) is increasingly recognized as an important component of ecological and evolutionary dynamics. However, most studies that have investigated INS have focused on the effects of niche width and inter- and intraspecific competition on INS in small-bodied species for short time periods, with less attention paid to INS in large-bodied reptilian predators and the effects of available prey types on INS. We investigated the prevalence, causes, and consequences of INS in foraging behaviors across different populations of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), the dominant aquatic apex predator across the southeast US, using stomach contents and stable isotopes. Gut contents revealed that, over the short term, although alligator populations occupied wide ranges of the INS spectrum, general patterns were apparent. Alligator populations inhabiting lakes exhibited lower INS than coastal populations, likely driven by variation in habitat type and available prey types. Stable isotopes revealed that over longer time spans alligators exhibited remarkably consistent use of variable mixtures of carbon pools (e.g., marine and freshwater food webs). We conclude that INS in large-bodied reptilian predator populations is likely affected by variation in available prey types and habitat heterogeneity, and that INS should be incorporated into management strategies to efficiently meet intended goals. Also, ecological models, which typically do not consider behavioral variability, should include INS to increase model realism and applicability.},

abstract = {The study of habitat selection and population interactions has a history about as long as any integrative topic in ecology. Its literature is classically scientific in the sense that it combines pattern discovery, theory, and empirical testing. It is, implicitly, one of the significant demonstrations that general ecological principles exist and can be discovered by hypothetico- deductive methodologies. I outline the development of the topic in the context of two questions, both of which take it as an assumption that habitat selection is an optimal-foraging process. How does habitat selection alter (or reinforce) the dynamics of population interactions? How do those interactions alter the optimal behavior? Competition within a single species forces the use of a wide variety of habitats. This has been shown in many taxa, and Fretwell's theory gives it a sound basis in evolutionary ecology. In other words, we ecologists know that the pattern exists, and we know why it exists. Ecologists are capitalizing on their understanding of single- species habitat selection to design methods for comparing fitnesses (and components of fitnesses) in different habitats. It has been known for 40 yr that a second, competing species can reverse the effects of competition within a species, producing habitat selection where it would not otherwise exist. For the past decade, however, we have been discovering that this effect is really a cluster of effects. Whether competition restores selectivity depends on the kind of competition at work and on the information-gathering abilities of foragers. So does the extent to which it is restored. Generally, the strongest separation of species by habitat selection results from distinct-preference competition between species whose individuals have very limited abili- ties to assess the density of food in a patch. (This model yields the "ghost of competition past.") But if individuals have much ability to assess food density, there is little or no increase likely in their selectivity compared with the single-species case. Other sorts of competition produce intermediate results. The effects of interspecific competition on habitat selection have been investigated with theory and experiment working closely together. The by-products of the com- bination have been that new sorts of competitive relationships have been suggested and that it has been possible to compare these relationships with those suggested from other areas of investigation such as plant-herbivore interactions, succession, and plant specializations. Habitat selection may stabilize predation as well as competition. Sih has shown that the conditions required for stabilization closely resemble those predicted by optimal-foraging theory: Victims need to prefer the safer habitat most when their populations are lowest or when their chance of being killed in the riskier habitat is highest. Numerous experiments show that foragers behave appropriately to protect themselves from predation. Multispecies studies emphasize the potential for differential susceptibility and optimal habitat selection to maintain diverse communities. Despite, or perhaps because of, the rich understanding that the study of habitat selection has already engendered, many new and exciting topics are emerging. Perhaps the most challenging is the combination of time scales that allows phenotypes to change morphologically and physio- logically as well as behaviorally. It seems probable that investig},

abstract = {1. Drought is a natural disturbance that can cause widespread mortality of aquatic organisms in wetlands. We hypothesized that seasonal drying of marsh surfaces (i.e. hydrological disturbance) shapes spatio-temporal patterns of fish populations. 2. We tested whether population dynamics of fishes were synchronized by hydrological disturbance (Moran effect) or distance separating study sites (dispersal). Spatio-temporal patterns were examined in local populations of five abundant species at 17 sites (sampled five times per year from 1996 to 2001) in a large oligotrophic wetland. 3. Fish densities differed significantly across spatio-temporal scales for all species. For all species except eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), a significant portion of spatio-temporal variation in density was attributed to drying events (used as a covariate). 4. We observed three patterns of response to hydrological disturbance. Densities of bluefin killifish (Lucania goodei), least killifish (Heterandria formosa), and golden top-minnow (Fundulus chrysotus) were usually lowest after a dry down and recovered slowly. Eastern mosquitofish showed no distinct response to marsh drying (i.e. they recovered quickly). Flagfish (Jordanella floridae) density was often highest after a dry down and then declined. Population growth after a dry down was often asymptotic for bluefin killifish and golden topminnow, with greatest asymptotic density and longest time to recovery at sites that dried infrequently. 5. Fish population dynamics were synchronized by hydrological disturbance (independent of distance) and distance separating study sites (independent of hydrological disturbance). Our ability to separate the relative importance of the Moran effect from dispersal was strengthened by a weak association between hydrological synchrony and distance among study sites. Dispersal was the primary mechanism for synchronous population dynamics of flagfish, whereas hydrological disturbance was the primary mechanism for synchronous population dynamics of the other species examined. 6. Species varied in the relative role of the Moran effect and dispersal in homogenizing their population dynamics, probably as a function of life history and ability to exploit dry-season refugia. {\textcopyright} 2005 British Ecological Society.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between prey availability and community structure of diving ducks during winter on northeastern Lake Ontario. Benthic and nektonic samples collected during fall, winter, and spring 2002–2004 indicated that macroinvertebrate numbers differed by location but generally did not decline throughout winter. Large accumulations of macroinvertebrates, apparently moved by wave action and currents, were documented in nearshore areas. Surveys showed that diving ducks congregated in mixed species flocks within areas of higher food abundance. Mixed species flocks were common in nearshore areas, likely because energydense foods (Amphipoda and Chironomidae) were abundant in the narrow zone of shallow water, close to shore. Although macroinvertebrate numbers likely affected habitat use by diving ducks, birds did not greatly reduce abundance of macroinvertebrates. It is unlikely that exploitative competition was occurring and interference competition appeared below threshold levels that would cause species to spatially segregate.

We injected frogs intraperitoneally (IP) with a gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone agonist at 0.31$\mu$g/50$\mu$L or vehicle control solution and determined behavioral outcomes. Next, we used GnRH-induced sexual behavior to determine the effects of a 30-day exposure to aqueous estradiol (E2) at 10 -8M or a common pollutant, 4-tert octylphenol (OP), at the environmentally relevant concentrations of 10 -7M OP or 10 -8M OP. The GnRH-agonist treatment had no effect on female behaviors. In males, GnRH-agonist treatment increased approaches, touches, amplexus, and a sum total of all sexual behaviors (total sexual behavior score). Exposure to E2 or any dose of OP had no effect on female behaviors. In males, E2 and 10 -7M OP increased incidence of arm waving (a potential pheromone releasing behavior), and E2, and both doses of OP increased calling behavior compared to an unexposed control group. More males in all the exposure groups expressed sexual behavior than in the control group.

abstract = {The increasing spread of contaminants in the environment affects the behaviour of individuals and can be predicted to modify population characteristics in the long run. It is thus crucial to investigate the effect of contaminants on fitness-related traits. Nitrate is a major pollutant that disrupts oxygen fixation and steroid metabolism and is expected to affect adult behaviour. In water breeding newts, reduced oxygen supply may increase predation risk by elevating surfacing rate and limiting the capacity to evade a predator. It may also reduce mating success by altering sexual behaviour. We assessed the effect of nitrate on fitness-related behavioural traits in male palmate newts Lissotriton helveticus. We measured courtship and breathing during sexual encounters and escape performance in exposed and non-exposed adults. Unexpectedly, exposed males courted females more often than control males. Body size and breathing rate were also positively related in control males but not in exposed males. Results only partially support the hypothesis of oxygen transfer disruption. Alternatively, exposed males seem to compensate their reduced olfactory attractiveness by decreasing surfacing and increasing courtship frequency. Surprisingly, nitrate did not affect escape performance possibly because anaerobic respiration supplies most of energy during unsustainable activity. Nitrate exposure altered time budget in exposed adults and shifted behavioural trade-offs between competing activities like breathing and courting. Ecological and evolutionary consequences, driven by changes on predation risk or sexual selection regimes, can be expected. This study calls for more attention on amphibian adult stages and the evolutionary response of populations in contaminated environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The occurrence of endocrine disruption is increasing and may now affect most, if not all, ecosystems. Owing to its impact on survival and reproduction, it is increasingly important to consider this factor in ecological studies. The study of secondary sexual traits is of particular interest because they are under strong hormonal control and play a crucial role in mating. A neglected sub-lethal effect of endocrine disruption is the reduction of male attractiveness, and the distortion of the sexual selection process.2. Nitrate is one of the most widespread endocrine disruptors because of its extensive use in agriculture. Studies, especially in amphibians, have mostly focused on early developmental stages, probably because these were considered critical for population dynamics. However, negative effects on adult survival or reproductive success may also affect population demography.3. We surveyed nitrate concentration in a large sample of ponds. We then exposed male palmate newts, Triturus helveticus, to high (75 mg L-1) but realistic concentration of sodium nitrate to investigate the effect of nitrate on the expression of secondary sexual traits and male attractiveness.4. Exposure to nitrate for 3 weeks was found to limit the expression of sexual traits and to reduce body growth; exposure for 10 days reduced male attractiveness. Female preferred males unexposed to nitrate in olfactory tests but not in visual tests.5. The expression of secondary sexual characteristics and body size is reduced in males exposed to realistic nitrate concentration. However, a drop in male attractiveness may first be caused by disruption of the production of olfactory cues. Depending on the frequency of contaminated breeding sites, the disruption of male ability to express sexual signals might affect the sexual selection process in palmate newts and eventually reduce population reproductive output. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of this result. {\textcopyright} 2009 British Ecological Society.},

All data were combined for a principal components analysis that discriminated two main groups: three generalist species that live in all types of habitat, and five specialist species that ranged from rather scarce to extremely rare and are found only in unaltered habitats. The three generalist snakes are not threatened and their IUCN category is Least Concern. Three out of the five specialist species are categorized as Near Threatened, Vulnerable, and Endangered at regional or national levels. The other two species are currently considered Not Threatened and we discuss whether they are incorrectly classified.

abstract = {Sexual reproduction is overwhelmingly the most common reproductive mode among Metazoans, although it has been secondarily lost in some organisms. Ephoron shigae is a geographically parthenogenetic mayfly. Here, we provide details of the frequency of bisexual and parthenogenetic strains of E. shigae together with data on their sex ratios in the Abukuma-gawa River and one of its downstream tributaries, the Surikami-gawa River, in Japan. In a previous study in the 1990s, bisexual populations were observed in both rivers. The present study clearly shows that sex ratios have since changed to be almost entirely unisexual within the downstream area of the Abukuma-gawa River and the Surikami-gawa River. Our genetic analyses also show that these females are of a parthenogenetic strain, and that the original bisexual strains were overwhelmed within a period of <20 years. However, it was recently observed that many males and females of the bisexual strains continue to inhabit upstream areas of the Abukuma-gawa River. Therefore, we suggest that the parthenogenetic strains have increased in abundance primarily downstream. We show that a drastic change has occurred over a short period, involving the replacement of one strain and a corresponding change in reproductive mode along a riverine environment.},

abstract = {Abstract: Terrestrial habitats surrounding wetlands are critical to the management of natural resources. Although the protection of water resources from human activities such as agriculture, silviculture, and urban development is obvious, it is also apparent that terrestrial areas surrounding wetlands are core habitats for many semiaquatic species that depend on mesic ecotones to complete their life cycle. For purposes of conservation and management, it is important to define core habitats used by local breeding populations surrounding wetlands. Our objective was to provide an estimate of the biologically relevant size of core habitats surrounding wetlands for amphibians and reptiles. We summarize data from the literature on the use of terrestrial habitats by amphibians and reptiles associated with wetlands ( 19 frog and 13 salamander species representing 1363 individuals; 5 snake and 28 turtle species representing more than 2245 individuals ). Core terrestrial habitat ranged from 159 to 290 m for amphibians and from 127 to 289 m for reptiles from the edge of the aquatic site. Data from these studies also indicated the importance of terrestrial habitats for feeding, overwintering, and nesting, and, thus, the biological interdependence between aquatic and terrestrial habitats that is essential for the persistence of populations. The minimum and maximum values for core habitats, depending on the level of protection needed, can be used to set biologically meaningful buffers for wetland and riparian habitats. These results indicate that large areas of terrestrial habitat surrounding wetlands are critical for maintaining biodiversity.

abstract = {Expansion of conifer woodlands into sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems is a primary threat to the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in the Great Basin, southeast Oregon, USA. Conifer removal to restore sage-grouse habitats has been widely implemented, yet limited information exists on the effects of conifer expansion on sage-grouse habitat selection. Our objective was to evaluate the landscape-scale effects of conifer expansion on selection of sites for nesting and to estimate direction, magnitude, and scale of effects. We classified 160 nests and 167 available sites with random forests during 2010–2011 to assess effects of conifer cover and tree clustering at multiple scales along with other vegetation and topographic covariates on selection of nesting habitat. Relative probability of nesting was negatively associated with >3% conifer cover within 800 m of nests. When trees were present within 800 m of nests, sage-grouse nested where trees were clustered rather than dispersed, suggesting selection for more open habitat. Results further indicated that sage-grouse are nesting in landscapes susceptible to conifer expansion that have yet to be invaded. Sage-grouse are expected to lose nesting habitat as conifer expansion continues, but management intervention may be a possible solution to increase habitat availability where open space for nesting is a limiting factor. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract = {Knowledge of movements, habitat use, and resource requirements is critical to designing management strategies for species with a conservation status. For snakes, basic research needed to derive this information is often lacking or insufficient. We used radio telemetry to investigate the spatial ecology and habitat use of 21 adult Western Foxsnakes (Pantherophis vulpinus) during a single activity season at Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge in northwest Missouri, near the species' southern range limit. At the landscape level, monitored snakes located their home ranges in lowland areas in association with wet prairies and managed wetlands but avoided agricultural plots and were not observed to occupy upland areas. Snakes were not selective of macrohabitat within their home ranges but selected microhabitats with denser herbaceous vegetation than typically available at random sites, suggesting that snakes were responding mainly to microhabitat features at the home-range level. Unlike many other temperate snake species, P. vulpinus did not exhibit any sexual differences in selection of microhabitats because all snakes appeared to prefer dense vegetative structure. Home-range sizes were relatively large in comparison to many other terrestrial temperate colubrids and seemed to be explained by resource distribution patterns, such as the proximity of hibernacula and oviposition sites to foraging habitat. Movement patterns varied seasonally among sexes with males demonstrating peak movement distances in May and females in July, respectively. Management decisions to minimize habitat manipulations during the snake activity season and protect embankments used for hibernacula and oviposition will likely benefit Foxsnake conservation.},

abstract = {Six species of elapid snakes were studied in a highlands region of eastern Australia. Major results were as follows. (I) These snakes are opportunistic feeders, relatively unselective with respect to prey type or prey size. (2) Despite this unselective feeding, over 60% of the diet (by weight) in all species consists oflizards and frogs. Published data show a preponderance of these prey types in Australian snakes as a whole, and I suggest that this is due to the scarcity of other potential prey items (especially small mammals and freshwater fish) in Australia. (3) Sympatry is less common in the elapids studied than among North American snakes in comparable climatic regions. I attribute the scarcity of sympatry among the Australian snakes to the restricted number of prey types available. This argument is supported by previous empirical work which suggests that prey species diversity determines snake species diversity. Observed prey-size differences between sympatric elapid species are consistent with the interpretation of interspecific competi- tive exclusion, SHINE,},

abstract = {An individual's sex, body size and colour pattern can influence its habitat use, and such partitioning can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. We studied a system very different from those that have attracted previous research on this topic: sea snakes (Emydocephalus annulatus) in shallow-water coral-reef areas of New Caledonia. The snakes used habitats non-randomly in terms of substrate types and water depths, with frequent use of coral-rubble areas that also contained the nests of fish (damselfish and blennies) whose eggs are eaten by these snakes. Mate-searching adult male snakes were found across a broader range of habitat types than were foraging females and juveniles. Smaller snakes were found in shallower water. Colour polymorphism was evident (melanism increased with body size, and was more common in males than in females) but did not affect habitat use. The effects of colour morph on operative temperatures of physical models (evident in terrestrial situations) disappeared under water. Habitat use in this population is affected by a snake's body size and sex, but not by colour. Studies of terrestrial snakes have emphasized thermal or camouflage benefits of colour polymorphism, but the superficially similar polymorphism in E. annulatus is not consistent with either of these hypotheses and thus challenges their generality. Similarly, there was no dietary difference between age or sex groups and thus dietary partitioning cannot explain the observed intraspecific habitat partitioning. {\textcopyright} 2003 The Linnean Society of London.},

Microhabitat temperatures were substantially lower at the closed-canopy site, where EMRs selected the warmest available basking sites. Eastern massasauga rattlesnakes in the open-canopy population selected basking sites that afforded greater cryptic cover.

abstract = {Species distributions have shifted in response to global warming in all major ecosystems on the Earth. Despite cogent evidence for these changes, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and currently imply gradual shifts. Yet there is an increasing appreciation of the role of discrete events in driving ecological change. We show how a marine heat wave (HW) eliminated a prominent habitat-forming seaweed, Scytothalia dorycarpa, at its warm distribution limit, causing a range contraction of approximately 100 km (approx. 5% of its global distribution). Seawater temperatures during the HW exceeded the seaweed's physiological threshold and caused extirpation of marginal populations, which are unlikely to recover owing to life-history traits and oceanographic processes. Scytothalia dorycarpa is an important canopy-forming seaweed in temperate Australia, and loss of the species at its range edge has caused structural changes at the community level and is likely to have ecosystem-level implications. We show that extreme warming events, which are increasing in magnitude and frequency, can force step-wise changes in species distributions in marine ecosystems. As such, return times of these events have major implications for projections of species distributions and ecosystem structure, which have typically been based on gradual warming trends. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Adult males (n = 20) and females (n = 15) were surgically implanted with radio-transmitters and tracked every 48 h during the active season (April through October) for three consecutive years (2001 to 2003). From late autumn to early spring (November through March), when snakes were hibernating and thus inactive, tracking was reduced to once per week. We generated data on movement and other spatial parameters for each subject using GPS coordinates. There were significant sex differences in activity range size and multiple movement parameters. Throughout the active season males had greater activity range sizes and showed greater movement than females. This trend was pronounced during the mating season, which was restricted to late summer and early fall (late July through September). In contrast to most populations of A. contortrix from more southern and western localities, we did not observe any sexual activity (e.g., courtship, coitus, and male-male fighting) in the spring. Individuals of both sexes showed annual fidelity to: (i) activity range location, (ii) activity range size, (iii) movement distances, (iv) particular features of their activity ranges (e.g., refuge sites), and (v) hibernation sites. Males and females showed no difference in preferred seasonal habitats. In both sexes, shifts in habitat associations during the active season included migrations from over-wintering sites within basalt trap rockslides to upper-elevation, open deciduous forest during the summer foraging and reproductive season.

abstract = {Decisions under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) require scientific input on the risk that the species will become extinct. A series of critiques on the role of science in ESA decisions have called for improved consistency and transparency in species risk assessments and clear distinctions between science input and policy application. To address the critiques and document the emerging practice of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), we outline an assessment process based on principles and practices of risk and decision analyses that results in a scientific report on species status. The species status assessment (SSA) process has three successive stages: 1) document the life history and ecological relationships of the species in question to provide the foundation for the assessment, 2) describe and hypothesize causes for the current condition of the species, and 3) forecast the species' future condition. The future condition refers to the ability of a species to sustain populations in the wild under plausible future scenarios. The scenarios help explore the species' response to future environmental stressors and to assess the potential for conservation to intervene to improve its status. The SSA process incorporates modeling and scenario planning for prediction of extinction risk and applies the conservation biology principles of representation, resiliency, and redundancy to evaluate the current and future condition. The SSA results in a scientific report distinct from policy application, which contributes to streamlined, transparent, and consistent decision-making and allows for greater technical participation by experts outside of the USFWS, for example, by state natural resource agencies. We present two case studies based on assessments of the eastern massasauga rattlesnake Sistrurus catenatus and the Sonoran Desert tortoise Gopherus morafkai to illustrate the process. The SSA builds upon the past threat-focused assessment by including systematic and explicit analyses of a species' future response to stressors and conservation, and as a result, we believe it provides an improved scientific analysis for ESA decisions.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances can constrain the realized niche space of wildlife by inducing avoidance behaviors and altering community dynamics. Human activity might contribute to reduced partitioning of niche space by carnivores that consume similar resources, both by promoting tolerant species while also altering behavior of species (e.g. activity patterns). We investigated the influence of anthropogenic disturbance on habitat and dietary niche breadth and overlap among competing carnivores, and explored if altered resource partitioning could be explained by human-induced activity shifts. To describe the diets of coyotes, bobcat, and gray foxes, we designed a citizen science program to collect carnivore scat samples in low- (‘wildland') and high- (‘interface') human-use open space preserves, and obtained diet estimates using a DNA metabarcoding approach. Habitat use was determined at scat locations. We found that coyotes expanded habitat and dietary niche breadth in interface preserves, whereas bobcats and foxes narrowed both niche breadth measures. High human use was related to increased dietary niche overlap among all mesocarnivore pairs, increased coyote habitat overlap with bobcats and foxes, and a small reduction in habitat overlap between bobcats and foxes. The strongest increase in diet overlap was among coyotes and foxes, which was smaller in magnitude than their habitat overlap increase. Finally, coyote scats were more likely to contain nocturnal prey in interface preserves, whereas foxes appeared to reduce consumption of nocturnal prey. Our results suggest that dominant and generalist mesocarnivores may encroach on the niche space of subordinate mesocarnivores in areas with high human activity, and that patterns in resource use may be related to human-induced activity shifts.},

Habitat use was determined at scat locations. We found that coyotes expanded habitat and dietary niche breadth in interface preserves, whereas bobcats and foxes narrowed both niche breadth measures. High human use was related to increased dietary niche overlap among all mesocarnivore pairs, increased coyote habitat overlap with bobcats and foxes, and a small reduction in habitat overlap between bobcats and foxes. The strongest increase in diet overlap was among coyotes and foxes, which was smaller in magnitude than their habitat overlap increase. Finally, coyote scats were more likely to contain nocturnal prey in interface preserves, whereas foxes appeared to reduce consumption of nocturnal prey. Our results suggest that dominant and generalist mesocarnivores may encroach on the niche space of subordinate mesocarnivores in areas with high human activity, and that patterns in resource use may be related to human-induced activity shifts.},

abstract = {Gape-limited predators are restricted in the shape and size of prey items they can ingest by their trophic morphology. Evolutionary theory predicts that gape-limited predators, such as rattlesnakes, should possess plasticity in their trophic morphology to allow them to respond to environmental cues about their prey base. This study examined the effects of two possible influences over trophic morphology in the pit-viper Crotalus viridis viridis. Snakes from six litters were exposed to diet manipulations performed over 480 days. By day 480, snakes from two prey-size treatments exhibited significantly different head shapes. Snakes reared on whole rodents had broader heads, whereas snakes force-fed homogenized prey had narrower heads. Shape differences varied among litters, suggesting that not all litters responded the same to diet manipulations. Results suggest that trophic morphology of rattlesnakes is plastic, at least in some litters, and can be induced by prey items. J. Morphol. 275:1339-1348, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Tens-of-thousands of chemicals are registered in the U.S. for use in countless processes and products. Recent evidence suggests that many of these chemicals are measureable in environmental and/or biological systems, indicating the potential for widespread exposures. Traditional public health research tools, including in vivo studies and targeted analytical chemistry methods, have been unable to meet the needs of screening programs designed to evaluate chemical safety. As such, new tools have been developed to enable rapid assessment of potentially harmful chemical exposures and their attendant biological responses. One group of tools, known as “non-targeted analysis” (NTA) methods, allows the rapid characterization of thousands of never-before-studied compounds in a wide variety of environmental, residential, and biological media. This article discusses current applications of NTA methods, challenges to their effective use in chemical screening studies, and ways in which shared resources (e.g., chemical standards, databases, model predictions, and media measurements) can advance their use in risk-based chemical prioritization. A brief review is provided of resources and projects within EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) that provide benefit to, and receive benefits from, NTA research endeavors. A summary of EPA's Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT) is also given, which makes direct use of ORD resources to benefit the global NTA research community. Finally, a research framework is described that shows how NTA methods will bridge chemical prioritization efforts within ORD. This framework exists as a guide for institutions seeking to understand the complexity of chemical exposures, and the impact of these exposures on living systems.},

abstract = {While human-induced rapid environmental changes are putting many organisms at risk of extinction, others are doing better than ever. This raises the question of why organisms differ in their tolerance to environmental alterations. Here, we ask whether and how behavioural adjustments assist animals in dealing with the urbanization process, one of the primary causes of biodiversity loss and biotic homogenization. Based on a literature review, we present both theoretical and empirical arguments to show that behavioural adjustments to urban habitats are widespread and that they may potentially be important in facilitating resource use, avoiding disturbances and enhancing communication. While a growing number of studies report behavioural differences between urban and nonurban animals, very few studies directly address the underlying mechanisms. In some cases, the changes in behaviour occur very rapidly and involve learning, and hence can be attributed to behavioural plasticity. In other cases, however, it cannot be ruled out that behavioural differences between urban and nonurban animals result from natural selection or nonrandom sorting of individuals by behavioural traits that affect dispersal, habitat selection or establishment. Because the urbanization process is expected to continue to threaten biodiversity in the near future, there is some urgency to improve our understanding of the mechanisms through which behaviour helps animals to cope with such environmental alterations. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

We obtained 21 specimens during several visits to the park from 1993 to 1996. Neonates were observed only during late May through July, despite searching in other months, suggesting that birth in this subspecies occurs at the beginning of the rainy season. Fecal analyses revealed differences in diet composition between juveniles and adults. Juveniles prey primarily on lizards and various species of frogs, whereas adults eat rodents. This ontogenetic change in diet does not seem to trigger any corresponding change in venom composition with snake age. Venom of this subspecies is highly toxic (LD50 = 1.25 ?ig/g), and has elevated hemorrhagic, hemolytic, and myotoxic activities. Extreme deforestation of dry forest habitats in the Pacific lowlands of Central America has made A. bilineatus a rare species over most of its range.

abstract = {1. Fecundity estimates for demographic modelling are difficult to acquire at the regional spatial scales that correspond to climate shifts, land use impacts or habitat management programmes. Yet they are important for evaluating such effects. While waterfowl managers have historically used harvest-based age ratios to assess fecundity at continental scales, widely available age ratios from late summer banding (ringing) data present an underutilized opportunity to examine a regional fecundity index with broad temporal replication. 2. We used age ratios from banding data and hierarchical mixed-effect models to examine how fecundity of five North American dabbling duck species was affected by temporal variation in hydrological cycles, intra- and interspecific density dependence and alternate prey availability, and whether those relationships were consistent across a broad geographic area. 3. Model-estimated fecundity was within the range of traditional harvest-based fecundity estimates for each species. Ecological covariates explained between 16% and 53% of the temporal variation in fecundity, dependent on species. Increasing wetland inundation and an indicator of vole population irruptions were consistent predictors of increasing fecundity across all species. Species exhibited mixed positive and negative responses to interspecific and intraspecific breeding pair densities hypothesized to affect nest and brood survival respectively, highlighting the importance of integrating brood survival into fecundity metrics for precocial species. 4. Declines in fecundity over time and across space at more northern latitudes may reflect stronger policies for grassland and wetland protection in the U.S. versus Canadian portions of the prairies over the time period of our study. Maintaining the capacity of less permanent basins to rehydrate in wetter periods through easement protection benefits fecundity, particularly for late-nesting species that acquire a greater proportion of their reproductive energy on the breeding grounds. 5. Synthesis and applications. Age ratios derived from postbreeding banding operations allowed us to attribute variation in waterfowl fecundity to temporal ecological variables. Effects of habitat management for waterfowl may be masked unless analysts account for this temporal variation. Postbreeding-pulse age ratios atcapture could be useful as fecundity metrics in integrated population models and for evaluating population dynamics of extensively banded nongame species, especially if adjusted for capture vulnerability using within-season recapture data.},

We tracked dietary shifts by feral cats (Felis catus), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and dingoes (Canis dingo) through a non-cyclic irruption of small mammalian prey in the Simpson Desert, central Australia. We predicted that all three predators would alter their diets to varying degrees as small mammals declined post irruption, and to test our predictions we live-trapped small mammals through the irruption event and collected scats to track predator diets. Red foxes and dingoes included a broader variety of prey in their diets as small mammals declined. Feral cats did not exhibit a similar dietary shift, but did show variable use and selectivity of small mammal species through the irruption cycle. Results were largely consistent with prior studies that highlighted the opportunistic feeding habits of the red fox and dingo. They also, however, showed that feral cats may exhibit less dietary flexibility in response to small mammal irruptions, emphasizing the importance of tracking predator diets before, during and after irruption events.},

abstract = {Managed wetlands on public lands in Illinois, United States, provide foraging habitats for migrating and wintering waterfowl. However, few studies have estimated abundances of waterfowl foods in mid-migration regions of North America, yet such information is needed to inform management and conservation decision-making. During 2005-2007, we used a multistage sampling design to estimate moist-soil plant seed production (kg/ha, dry mass) and energetic carrying capacity at sites managed by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and modeled variation in seed biomass. Average seed biomass among all sites ranged from 1,030.0 6 64.1 (SE) kg/ha in 2005 to 501.5 ± 124.1 kg/ha in 2007. Our overall estimate (2005-2007) of moist-soil plant seed biomass was precise (691.3 6 56.4 kg/ ha; CV: 8.2%), equaling 5,128 energetic use-days/ha. This value was similar to or slightly greater than previous estimates from other regions of North America and exceeded the estimate used the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Region Joint Venture for waterfowl conservation planning (514 kg/ha). We formulated eight models to predict abundance of moist-soil plant seeds within sampled wetlands. The best approximating model included the number of desirable plant species within wetlands and study year. The second best model included the categorical effect of management intensity and indicated that, although variable, actively managed wetlands produced about 240 kg/ha more seed than those that were passively managed. As with other regions, wetland management practices that encourage diverse plant communities over monotypes and growth of early successional plants should yield substantial increases in waterfowl food abundances at Illinois Department of Natural Resources sites, especially given that only 27% of our study wetlands were actively managed. Such efforts would also help reduce deficits in energetic carrying capacity identified by the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Region Joint Venture.},

Snakes are often found in species-rich assemblages while exploiting similar resources; because snake body size is a relatively plastic trait that determines the range of prey sizes an individual may consume, divergence in body size between sympatric species may arise as a result of interspecific interactions. The North American racer, Coluber constrictor, and the larger coachwhip, Coluber flagellum, have a close taxonomic relationship and similar foraging strategies. Therefore, we hypothesized that C. constrictor would be smaller where they co-occur with C. flagellum, as compared to where C. flagellum is absent, throughout the southeastern extent of their range. To evaluate this hypothesis, we obtained data on body size for 2321 adult C. constrictor and 526 adult C. flagellum, along with habitat data and other potentially important factors influencing body size. Coluber constrictor was smaller than elsewhere when in peninsular Florida, in pine forests, on hydric soils and in the presence of the larger and potentially competing C. flagellum. Body size of C. flagellum did not vary by any measured habitat variables. The trends we documented are consistent with the hypothesis that C. constrictor body size is influenced by several variables, including co-occurrence with C. flagellum.},

abstract = {Snakes often occur in species-rich assemblages, and sympatry is thought to be facilitated primarily by low diet overlap, not interspecific interactions. We selected, a priori, three species pairs consisting of species that are morphologically and taxonomically similar and may therefore be likely to engage in interspecific, consumptive competition. We then examined a large-scale database of snake detection/nondetection data and used occupancy modelling to determine whether these species occur together more or less frequently than expected by chance while accounting for variation in detection probability among species and incorporating important habitat categories in the models. For some snakes, we obtained evidence that the probabilities that habitat patches are used are influenced by the presence of potentially competing congeneric species. Specifically, timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) were less likely than expected by chance to use areas that also contained eastern diamond-backed rattlesnakes (Crotalus adamanteus) when the proportion of evergreen forest was relatively high. Otherwise, they occurred together more often than expected by chance. Complex relationships were revealed between habitat use, detection probabilities and occupancy probabilities of North American racers (Coluber constrictor) and coachwhips (Coluber flagellum) that indicated the probability of competitive exclusion increased with increasing area of grassland habitat, although there was some model uncertainty. Cornsnakes (Pantherophis guttatus or Pantherophis slowinskii) and ratsnakes (Pantherophis alleghaniensis, Pantherophis spiloides, or Pantherophis obsoletus) exhibited differences in habitat selection, but we obtained no evidence that patterns of use for this species pair were influenced by current interspecific interactions. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that competitive interactions influence snake assemblage composition; the strength of these effects was affected by landscape-scale habitat features. Furthermore, we suggest that current interspecific interactions may influence snake occupancy, challenging the paradigm that contemporary patterns of snake co-occurrence are largely a function of diet partitioning that arose over evolutionary time.},

abstract = {A multi-trophic perspective improves understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of rapid environmental change on insect herbivores. Loss of specialized enemies due to human impacts is predicted to dramatically reduce the number of tritrophic niches of herbivores compared to a bitrophic niche perspective. Habitat fragmentation and climate change promote the loss of both specialist enemies and herbivores, favoring ecological generalism across trophic levels. Species invasion can fundamentally alter trophic interactions toward various outcomes and contributes to ecological homogenization.

abstract = {Riparian vegetation in dry regions is influenced by low-flow and high-flow components of the surface and groundwater flow regimes. The duration of no-flow periods in the surface stream controls vegetation structure along the low-flow channel, while depth, magnitude and rate of groundwater decline influence phreatophytic vegetation in the floodplain. Flood flows influence vegetation along channels and floodplains by increasing water availability and by creating ecosystem disturbance. On reference rivers in Arizona's Sonoran Desert region, the combination of perennial stream flows, shallow groundwater in the riparian (stream) aquifer, and frequent flooding results in high plant species diversity and landscape heterogeneity and an abundance of pioneer wetland plant species in the floodplain. Vegetation changes on hydrologically altered river reaches are varied, given the great extent of flow regime changes ranging from stream and aquifer dewatering on reaches affected by stream diversion and groundwater pumping to altered timing, frequency, and magnitude of flood flows on reaches downstream of flow-regulating dams. As stream flows become more intermittent, diversity and cover of herbaceous species along the low-flow channel decline. As groundwater deepens, diversity of riparian plant species (particularly perennial species) and landscape patches are reduced and species composition in the floodplain shifts from wetland pioneer trees (Populus, Salix) to more drought-tolerant shrub species including Tamarix (introduced) and Bebbia. On impounded rivers, changes in flood timing can simplify landscape patch structure and shift species composition from mixed forests composed of Populus and Salix, which have narrow regeneration windows, to the more reproductively opportunistic Tamarix. If flows are not diverted, suppression of flooding can result in increased density of riparian vegetation, leading in some cases to very high abundance of Tamarix patches. Coarsening of sediments in river reaches below dams, associated with sediment retention in reservoirs, contributes to reduced cover and richness of herbaceous vegetation by reducing water and nutrient-holding capacity of soils. These changes have implications for river restoration. They suggest that patch diversity, riparian plant species diversity, and abundance of flood-dependent wetland tree species such as Populus and Salix can be increased by restoring fluvial dynamics on flood-suppressed rivers and by increasing water availability in rivers subject to water diversion or withdrawal. On impounded rivers, restoration of plant species diversity also may hinge on restoration of sediment transport. Determining the causes of vegetation change is critical for determining riparian restoration strategies. Of the many riparian restoration efforts underway in south-western United States, some focus on re-establishing hydrogeomorphic processes by restoring appropriate flows of surface water, groundwater and sediment, while many others focus on manipulating vegetation structure by planting trees (e.g. Populus) or removing trees (e.g. Tamarix). The latter approaches, in and of themselves, may not yield desired restoration outcomes if the tree species are indicators, rather than prime causes, of underlying changes in the physical environment. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors, Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Individual animals undergoing ontogenetic shifts in habitat use may establish a mobile link between discrete ecosystems via movement of energy, nutrients and matter, as well as through impacts on ecosystem and habitat structure. The American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is a model species for studying ecological implications of ontogenetic niche shifts, because they grow in size by several orders of magnitude, and they play a critical role as both top predators and ecosystem engineers. We used equal trapping effort, radio telemetry and nest surveys to document ontogenetic habitat shifts of alligators between hydrologically isolated, seasonal wetlands and riverine systems. To estimate the degree of functional connectivity between systems, we quantified alligator biomass and nutrient excretion in both systems. Seasonal wetlands provided nesting and nursery sites for adult females and juveniles, which constituted 0.78 g/m2 biomass and excreted 0.05 g/m2/yr N, P, Ca, Mg, Na and K in that system. In contrast, the riverine system provided non-nesting habitat for adults and sub-adults of both sexes, totaling 0.18 g/m2 biomass and excreting 0.01 g/m2/yr of nutrients. Furthermore, sub-adults and adult females were documented moving across the terrestrial matrix, while adult males spent the duration of the study in the creek. Our results demonstrated that ontogenetic niche shifts in alligators establish connectivity between seasonal wetlands and riverine systems and with the surrounding terrestrial matrix. These findings have implications for the definition of jurisdictional wetlands under the US Supreme Court's 2001 SWANCC decision and highlight the importance of ecological, as well as hydrological, connectivity. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We evaluated the spatial ecology and habitat use of the Copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix) in managed, pine-hardwood forests in the William B. Bankhead National Forest, Alabama. We used radiotelemetry to monitor 31 snakes (23 males, 8 females [5 gravid and 3 non-gravid females]) over a period of 3 years (2006–2008). Snakes were tracked for one or more seasons in a series of 18 forest stands composed of 6 treatments (Control, Burn, Light Thin, Heavy Thin, Light Thin with Burn, and Heavy Thin with Burn) replicated three times. Home-range estimates for male snakes averaged 17.8 ± 2.3 (based on Utilization Distributions [UD]) and 12.0 ± 1.9 ha (based on 100% Minimum Convex Polygons [MCP]), whereas home-range estimates for gravid female snakes averaged 7.1 ± 1.8 ha (based on UD) and 4.1 ± 1.1 ha (based on MCP) and were significantly different between both sexes for all home-range analyses. We did not detect an effect of forest management on home-range size of male snakes. Macrohabitat use differed among male and gravid female snakes, where male snakes used edge (field and secondary road edges) and Southern Pine Beetle macrohabitats in significantly greater proportion than what was available. Gravid female snakes did not use macrohabitats differently than what was available, but tended to use thinned stands and forest stand canopy gaps for parturition sites. Microhabitat use patterns were similar between male and gravid female snakes, where both sexes tended to use microhabitat sites with relatively greater litter depth and coarse woody debris percent cover compared to random microhabitat sites. Microhabitat use patterns for male snakes tended to differ based on forest management treatment (Thin and Thin with Burn versus Control and Burn stands), where selected microhabitat sites had lower ambient and soil temperatures compared to random sites in thinned stands. Collectively, we illustrated that male A. contortrix displayed hierarchical habitat use, whereas female A. contortrix displayed preference for habitat features at the microhabitat scale only. Overall, our short-term study provides evidence that recently-thinned pine-hardwood stands are not initially used at a frequency greater than their availability, which suggests that microhabitat and microclimate conditions likely limit use immediately following management.},

abstract = {We present the first attempt of mapping global conservation priorities for two snake clades, Viperidae and Elapidae. We compared the global conservation priorities of each clade with the nine global conservation schemes defined by Brooks et al. to evaluate how effective these schemes are in ensuring the preservation of viperid and elapid biodiversity. Based on range maps of 228 species of Viperidae and 224 species of Elapidae, we used systematic conservation planning methods of complementarity and irreplaceability to generate a set of conservation networks under two cost scenarios: (1) minimizing conservation-human development conflicts and (2) maximizing environmental suitability for high snake richness. Analysis of variance was used to investigate whether the mean irreplaceability of cells matching the areas covered by each of the nine global prioritization schemes in Brooks et al. was higher than the mean irreplaceability of cells located outside these areas. Overall, few areas showed irreplaceability higher than 0.5 based on a goal of representing 25% of the species' ranges. The conservation networks generated in expectation of low conflicts between human development and conservation were quite different from the networks of high environmental suitability. Areas with higher irreplaceability coincided with the regions covered by global schemes of Endemic Bird Areas (for Viperidae and Elapidae) and High-Biodiversity Wilderness (for Elapidae). Our findings indicated the existence of viable conservation opportunities for these two snake groups. This study can be viewed as a way to overcome, at least in part, the recent criticism concerning the independent development of several global conservation priorities by evaluating which groups of organisms are better represented in each of them. More than simply determining priorities for snakes' conservation, our analyses showed that the development of parallel priority-setting initiatives can be reconciled with those strategies for which financial resources are already being designed.},

abstract = {Aquatic and terrestrial environments are increasingly contaminated by anthropogenic sources that include pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and industrial and agricultural chemicals (i. e., pesticides). Many of these substances have the potential to disrupt endocrine function, yet their effect on thyroid hormone (TH) action has garnered relatively little attention. Anuran postembryonic metamorphosis is strictly dependent on TH and perturbation of this process can serve as a sensitive barometer for the detection and mechanistic elucidation of TH disrupting activities of chemical contaminants and their complex mixtures. The ecological threats posed by these contaminants are further exacerbated by changing environmental conditions such as temperature, photoperiod, pond drying, food restriction, and ultraviolet radiation. We review the current knowledge of several chemical and environmental factors that disrupt TH-dependent metamorphosis in amphibian tadpoles as assessed by morphological, thyroid histology, behavioral, and molecular endpoints. Although the molecular mechanisms for TH disruption have yet to be determined for many chemical and environmental factors, several affect TH synthesis, transport or metabolism with subsequent downstream effects. As molecular dysfunction typically precedes phenotypic or histological pathologies, sensitive assays that detect changes in transcript, protein, or metabolite abundance are indispensable for the timely detection of TH disruption. The emergence and application of ‘omics techniques—genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics—on metamorphosing tadpoles are powerful emerging assets for the rapid, proxy assessment of toxicant or environmental damage for all vertebrates including humans. Moreover, these highly informative ‘omics techniques will complement morphological, behavioral, and histological assessments, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of how TH-dependent signal disruption is propagated by environmental contaminants and factors.},

abstract = {Resource partitioning, or differences in how species use resources, has been studied in a wide variety of amphibians and reptiles, and causes for resource- partitioning patterns are now understood in several well-documented cases. This study, a review of these papers, reveals a common theme: Resource-partitioning patterns result from three categories of causes, of which competition is just one; the other two are predation and factors that operate independently of interspe- cific interactions, such as physiological constraints. Moreover, in each of the case histories presented below, we find two or more mechanisms interacting in complex ways. In no case does a single factor, for example competition, ever act alone. These case histories therefore provide an admonishment to single-minded tests of community-wide patterns that pit competition against everything (or nothing) else. Rather, a variety of factors may cause community-wide patterns such as resource partitioning, and the relative importance of these factors may differ among taxa and among communities at different geographic locations.},

It is often assumed that sympatric species within the same guild must employ some mechanism of niche diversifi- cation to coexist. Diving duck (Anatidae: Aythya Boie, 1822 and Oxyura Bonaparte, 1828) competition is poorly under- stood and current evidence of coexistence mechanisms is contradictory. In the spring and summer of 2001 and 2002, we tested whether diving ducks foraging within prairie potholes segregate by depth to avoid competition. We sought to ex- plain any segregation by sampling sediment particle size, compactness, and organic content; submergent vegetation; and benthic invertebrate densities in the foraging locations of each species. Our study was conducted at the wetland scale in southwestern Manitoba, Canada. We found that Redheads (Aythya americana (Eyton, 1838)), Ruddy Ducks (Oxyura ja- maicensis (J.F. Gmelin, 1789)), Canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria (Wilson, 1814)), and Ring-necked Ducks (Aythya collaris (Donovan, 1809)) foraged most often at shallow depths (50–100 cm), while Lesser Scaups (Aythya affinis (Eyton, 1838)) foraged at shallow to intermediate depths (50–150 cm). Thus, most divers did not segregate by depth. These results con- flict with an earlier study that reported diving ducks segregated by depth to avoid competition. Diving ducks likely forage where prey abundance is greatest relative to the cost of diving to obtain that prey.},

abstract = {Lowland riverine floodplains are among the most dynamic and heterogeneous of ecosystems, but many have been extensively modified. Their provision of important habitats provides a key motivation for restoring natural flow regimes (in terms of magnitude, frequency, duration, timing and rate of change of hydrological conditions). Despite general recognition that aquatic insects respond to changes in water availability, there is little agreement about the influence of flow regime components on community structure in floodplains. We analysed a 6-year (2005 and 2007-2011) data set of aquatic insects (Heteroptera and Coleoptera) in a large Danubian floodplain characterised by pronounced hydrological variability. We hypothesised that abundance and assemblage structure would depend on flow regime components. In particular, we predicted that high-flow events in the mainstream and concurrent high-magnitude floods of prolonged duration would have a positive effect on diversity and abundance and that insect assemblages would differ between phases of hydrological connectivity. In addition, we assessed whether the survival of two threatened aquatic insects, Graphoderus bilineatus and Berosus geminus, depends on hydrological connectivity. Abundance and species richness of Heteroptera and Coleoptera increased during years with frequent extremely high flood pulses and prolonged flooding. Multivariate ordination showed subtle relationships between hydrological conditions, hydrological connectivity and insect assemblages with number of days in flood providing the best fit. Spring floods had a more pronounced effect on the assemblages than autumn floods. The time lag between flood occurrence and its apparent effect on aquatic insects was 17-31 days, reflecting insect life cycles. The abundance of G. bilineatus (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) was affected by mean water level during the month preceding sampling, whereas the abundance of B. geminus (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae) was related to the occurrence of prolonged high-magnitude floods. The current water regime of the Danube River favours generalist species with high dispersal capacities and broad niches and food resources. Changes in flow management practices could remove the positive influence of floods on aquatic insect communities and lead to losses of threatened species that depend on these river-floodplain habitats. Our results contribute to the understanding necessary for appropriate evaluation and prioritisation of international floodplain conservation efforts.},

abstract = {1. While the use of aquatic protected areas that exclude angling might be considered an evolutionarily enlightened management approach to dealing with fisheries‐induced evolution (FIE), there is little empirical data on the effectiveness of this approach at maintaining the diversity of phenotypic traits within protected areas. 2. In species with paternal care, including largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), active nest‐ guarding and aggression towards potential brood predators by males may render these individ- uals particularly vulnerable to capture by angling because of increased propensity to attack fishing lures/bait near their nests. Relative levels of aggression by these males during the parental care period correlates with their vulnerability to angling year round. Selective removal of more aggressive individuals by anglers should drive population‐average phenotypes towards lower levels of aggression. 3. To assess the effectiveness of protected areas at mitigating FIE, the parental care behaviours of wild, free‐swimming male bass were compared during the early nesting period for bass within and outside protected areas in a lake in eastern Ontario. Nesting males within long‐ standing aquatic protected areas closed to fishing for >70 years were more aggressive towards bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), a potential nest predator, and patrolled larger areas around their nests compared with bass outside of sanctuaries. Males within protected areas were also more likely to strike at artificial fishing lures and were more prone to capture during angling events. 4. Collectively, the findings suggest that the establishment of protected areas may promote phe- notypic diversity such as more attentive and vigorous parental care, relative to areas open to angling. The extent to which this phenomenon occurs in other species and systems is likely to depend on the reproductive strategies of fish and their spatial ecology compared with protected area boundaries, and habitat quality within protected areas.},

abstract = {To assess the effectiveness of biochar and activated carbon (AC) for enhanced trace organic contaminant (TOrC) retention in stormwater infiltration systems, an approach combining forward-prediction modeling and laboratory verification experiments was employed. Batch and column tests were conducted using representative TOrCs and synthetic stormwater. Based on batch screening tests, two commercially available biochars (BN-biochar and MCG-biochar) and an AC were investigated. The AC exhibited the strongest sorption, followed by MCG-biochar and BN-biochar. Langmuir isotherms provided better fits to equilibrium data than Freundlich isotherms. Due to superior sorption kinetics, 0.2 wt % MCG-biochar in saturated sand columns retained TOrCs more effectively than 1.0 wt % BN-biochar. A forward-prediction intraparticle diffusion model based on the Langmuir isotherm adequately predicted column results when calibrated using only batch parameters, as indicated by a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis. Case study simulations estimated that an infiltration basin amended with F300-AC or MCG-biochar could obtain sorption-retarded breakthrough times for atrazine of 54 or 5.8 years, respectively, at a 1 in./h infiltration rate. These results indicate that biochars or ACs with superior sorption capacity and kinetics can enhance TOrC retention in infiltration systems, and performance under various conditions can be predicted using results from batch tests.},

abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation result in landscapes where high quality habitat patches are surrounded by matrix habitats of low and variable quality. For mobile species to persist in such landscapes, individual animals often rely on the high quality habitats but also use matrix habitats for supplemental resources or while moving between higher quality patches. Determining what habitat features animals select when in these matrix areas is important, as retaining desirable features in lower quality habitats may enable species persistence. We examine a population of US federally threatened Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) in northcentral Washington, near the southwestern range limit, where lynx habitat is fragmented by topography, wildfires, and human impacts. We used Global Positioning System radio-collar data from 17 lynx in the North Cascade Mountains during 2007–2013 to explore lynx habitat use. We used Random Forest models to analyze core hunting, resting, and denning habitat, and the habitats lynx select while between patches of core habitat. While selecting core habitat, lynx used spruce (Picea engelmannii)-fir (Abies lasiocarpa), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and mixed sub-boreal-Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests, and avoided dry forests and forest openings including new burns. When not in core habitat, lynx used a wider range of habitats, including new burns where fire skips and residual trees offered cover. Our results show clearly that Canada lynx tolerate a wider range of habitats where they occupy fragmented landscapes. Consequently, maintaining animals in fragmented landscapes requires that we identify and conserve not only the core habitats a particular species selects, but also the habitat features animals use while in less suitable environments.},

abstract = {Sexual dimorphism is a common phenomenon among animals. The usual cause cited for sexual dimorphism in animals is sexual selection acting through female choice or male-male combat.  Natural selection acting to reduce resource competition between the sexes, however, is an important alternative evolutionary scenario, but this possibility has received little empirical study.   Here this issue is addressed by examining the relationships among body size, head shape and the functional aspects of diet in the adult male and female cottonmouth snake Agkistrodon piscivorus.   In this species, males are larger in overall body and head size. Whereas an analysis of gross head measurements (simple linear head dimensions) shows little dimorphism in head shape, a more detailed analysis of head shape (using digital images of the snakes' heads) revealed some subtle, yet functionally significant, differences in head shape between adult male and female cottonmouths.  Specifically, male cottonmouths have longer quadrate bones, and have greater lateral surface areas than females. Male cottonmouths also consumed relatively taller prey (prey size relative to snake body size) than conspecific females, and the sexes consumed significantly different proportions of prey.   Because the size of the quadrate bone is a strong determinant of maximum gape in snakes, we suggest that the observed shape differences may reflect functional differences in maximum gape between similarly sized male and female cottonmouths. In turn, such differences in maximum gape width may explain why males consume taller prey than similarly sized females.},

abstract = {Recent studies comparing terrestrial versus aquatic locomotion in animals have shown that changes in kinematics, muscular activation patterns, and performance across media are often dramatic. Surprisingly, however, despite the importance of feeding to the survival of most animals, few studies have compared differences in feeding behaviour between media. The present study compares prey-capture behaviour, strike success, strike velocity and acceleration, and prey-capture kinematics in a semi-aquatic pitviper (Agkistrodon piscivorus) when capturing both terrestrial (mice) and aquatic (fish) prey in a standardized laboratory setting. Strike velocity and acceleration did not differ significantly between media, but instead were positively correlated with initial prey distance. By contrast, the kinematics of terrestrial and aquatic strikes differed significantly in several aspects: max gape angle during the retraction phase, angular velocity of mouth closing during the strike, and the initial head angle before the strike. Terrestrial strikes were associated with higher gape angles during the retraction phase, higher angular velocities of mouth closure, and a more inclined head angle at the onset of the strike. Finally, strike success differed significantly between strike types, with terrestrial strikes being considerably more successful than aquatic strikes. Strike success likely differed due to the relatively slow mouth-closing velocity of aquatic strikes.},

abstract = {Different animal intraspecific classes commonly differ in their prey selection. Such differences in feeding ecology are thought to reduce resource competition between classes, but other factors (i.e. behavioural, morphological, and phys- iological differences) also contribute to this widespread phenomenon. Although several studies have correlated the size of the feeding apparatus with prey selection in many animals, few studies have examined how the shape of the feeding apparatus is related to prey selection. Furthermore, even though the dietary regimen of many animals changes during ontogeny, few studies have examined how shape changes in the feeding apparatus may be related to these ontogenetic dietary shifts. Here we address these issues by examining how head shape, head size and prey selection change over ontogeny in adult males, adult females and juveniles of the cottonmouth snake Agkistrodon piscivorus. Our scaling data for head characteristics showed that all head measurements in adult male and female A. piscivorus scaled with significant negative allometry, whereas juvenile head measurements typically scaled iso- metrically, except for head volume (positive) and head length (negative). Thus, juveniles have relatively broad and high, but short, heads. Large adult male and female A. piscivorus have relatively small head dimensions overall. Thus, juveniles appear to undergo a rapid change in head volume, which subsequently slows considerably as sexual maturity is achieved. However, our multivariate analysis of size-adjusted head dimensions showed that juveniles dif- fered only slightly in their head shape compared with adult male and female A. piscivorus. In general, prey size increased with snake size across all age and sex groups, but an ontogenetic shift in prey type was not detected in either males or females},

abstract = {Despite their high diversity and importance as top predators in many ecosystems, the ecology of many snakes remains poorly understood. This situation is especially true at low latitudes, as few attempts have been made to quantify patterns of space usage by tropical snake species. Here, we describe macro- and microhabitat use by the abundant pit viper Bothrops asper in the lowlands of Costa Rica. Specifically, we used radiotelemetry to monitor nine female and four male adult snakes at La Selva Biological Station between 2004 and 2006. We determined macrohabitat usage and availability on the basis of the movements of individual snakes and analyzed selection using compositional analysis. Microhabitat was quantified by a series of structural characteristics, and groups of locations were compared using multivariate ANOVA and discriminant function analysis. In our study, B. asper demonstrated a positive selection for swamp habitat and avoidance of human-disturbed areas by both male and female snakes. Microhabitat usage did not differ between males and females, but did differ for all individuals between daytime observations, when snakes were typically inactive, and nocturnal observations, when snakes moved to more exposed areas and foraged using ambush tactics. Microhabitat characteristics were significantly nonrandom at both times, suggesting that B. asper actively select particular sites for both diurnal retreat and nocturnal foraging sites. These data emphasize that the contrasting ways in which animals may utilize resources at separate times or for different activities should be considered in studies of overall habitat selection.},
annote = {Observation: B. asper presents an ideal opportunity to study variation in spatial ecology and the factors that might influece it (i.e. sexual dimorphism).

Experiment: tried to determine the macrohabitat selection utilized between males and females or diurnal and nocturnal differences.

Aim: Present insight into the natural history and distribution of B. asper especially in information regarding habitat selection, particularly where there is potential for human conflict.

Methods:
4 types: Primary forest, secondary forest, swamp, and developed areas.

Results:
* Swamps were the signifantly used habitat.
* Developed areas were the most avoided areas, and microhabitat was unable to identify any interactions.
* Swamps have greater usage than availability.
* Prefered to be in tree logs during the day and leaf litter open canapy at night.

Conclusion:

* B. asper prefers swamp habitats, possibly due to susceptibility to desiccation, however foraging habits seems most likly. Exploting amphibians as a primary food source.
* Tended to utilize sites that were more structurally covered.},

Little is known about how these nitrate levels affect the early stages of amphibians in the field situation and if they contribute to the decline of amphibian populations.

When <i>R. temporaria</i> eggs were exposed to calcium nitrate in enclosures in a pond, survival at tailbud stage and at hatching did not differ from controls. The results suggest that ammonium nitrate can be detrimental to amphibian development but that increased nitrate levels have no direct adverse effects on tadpoles of <i>R. temporaria</i> and <i>B. bufo</i> and eggs of <i>R. temporaria</i> but indirectly enhance mass at metamorphosis.},

Radio transmitters were implanted in 4 male and 3 female snakes and used their daily positions as habitat sampling points. The available habitat was also sampled using randomly selected points. The snakes were located 472 times (> 90% success) which produced 107 habitat sample points. All snake example points were separated into active or inactive based on the length of time the snake remained in that position (< or > 7 days, respectively). During the bird breeding season black rat snakes showed a preference for field habitat although in both the field and deciduous forest the snake points were significantly clustered along the habitat interface. Following the bird breeding season, field and deciduous forest habitats were used in proportion to their availability and the preference for the ecotone was no longer found in field samples. Only limited evidence of non-random habitat use was found within habitats with regard to both plant species composition and vegetation structure. Inactive sites were diverse but all were located on the forest-field interface, had open exposure to direct sun and provided shelter for the snakes. Ideal habitat for black rat snakes is a small scale mosaic of field and forest and that their disappearance from other parts of their range in Canada may be related to the disappearance of such mosaics due to land clearing for agriculture.},

abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that most small Australian elapid snakes are nocturnal and rarely bask in the open because of the risk of predation by diurnal predatory birds. Because the physiology and behaviour of reptiles is temperature dependent, staying in refuges by day can entail high thermoregulatory costs, particularly for juveniles that must grow rapidly to maximise their chances of survival. We investigated whether the risk of predation deters juveniles of the endangered broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) from basking, and if so, whether there are thermal costs associated with refuge use. To estimate avian attack rates on snakes, we placed 900 plasticine snake replicas in sunny locations and underneath small stones on three sandstone plateaus for 72 h. At the same time we quantified the thermal benefits of basking vs refuge use. On sunny days, juveniles could maintain preferred body temperatures for 4.7 h by basking but only for 2.0 h if they remained inside refuges. Our predation experiment showed that basking has high costs for juvenile snakes. Predators attacked a significantly higher proportion of exposed models (13.3%) than models under rocks (1.6%). Birds were the major predators of exposed models (75% of attacks), and avian predation did not vary across the landscape. By trading heat for safety, juvenile H. bungaroides decreased the potential time period that they could maintain preferred body temperatures by 57%. Thermal costs of refuge use may therefore contribute to the slow growth and late maturation of this endangered species. Our results support the hypothesis that nocturnal activity in elapid snakes has evolved to minimise the risk of avian predation. Copyright {\textcopyright} Oikos 2005.},

This incident provided a natural experiment where we could measure, compare, and evaluate native stream amphibian densities as indicators of stream ecosystem stress. We employed a habitat-based, stratified sampling design to assess the impacts of these sediments on the densities of aquatic amphibians in five impacted streams by comparing them with densities in five adjacent, un-impacted (control) streams. Three species were sampled in numbers sufficient to be informative tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei, larvae), Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus, paedomorphs and larvae), and southern torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton variegatus, adults and larvae). Densities of amphibians were significantly lower in the streams impacted by sediment. While sediment effects were species specific, reflecting differential use of stream microhabitats, the shared vulnerability of these species to infusions of fine sediments is probably the result of their common reliance on interstitial spaces in the streambed matrix for critical life requisites, such as cover and foraging. Many stream-dwelling amphibians are highly philopatric and long-lived, and they exist in relatively stable populations. These attributes make them more tractable and reliable indicators of potential biotic diversity in stream ecosystems than anadromous fish or macroinvertebrates, and their relative abundance can be a useful indicator of stream condition.},

Recently, variance structure in the stable isotope composition of consumer tissues has been touted as a robust tool for quantifying trophic niche width, a task that has previously proven difficult due to bias in direct dietary analyses and difficulties in integrating diet composition over time. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses to examine trophic niche width of two sympatric aquatic snakes, banded watersnakes Nerodia fasciata and black swamp snakes Seminatrix pygaea inhabiting an isolated wetland where seasonal migrations of amphibian prey cause dramatic shifts in resource availability. Specifically, we characterized snake and prey isotope compositions through time, space, and ontogeny and examined isotope values in relation to prey availability and snake diets assessed by gut content analysis. We determined that prey cluster into functional groups based on similarity of isotopic composition and seasonal availability. Isotope variance structure indicated that the trophic niche width of the banded watersnake was broader (more generalist) than that of the black swamp snake. Banded watersnakes also exhibited seasonal variation in isotope composition, suggesting seasonal diet shifts that track amphibian prey availability. Conversely, black swamp snakes exhibited little seasonal variation but displayed strong ontogenetic shifts in carbon and nitrogen isotope composition that closely paralleled ontogenetic shifts in their primary prey, paedomorphic mole salamanders Ambystoma talpoideum. Although niche dimensions are often treated as static, our results demonstrate that seasonal shifts in niche dimensions can lead to changes in niche overlap between sympatric species. Such short-term fluctuations in niche overlap can influence competitive interactions and consequently the composition and dynamics of communities and ecosystems.},

Here, we examine the concept of a periodic table of niches and feasibility of niche classification schemes from functional trait and performance data. Niche differences and their influence on ecological patterns and processes could be revealed effectively by first performing data reduction/ordination analyses separately on matrices of trait and performance data compiled according to logical associations with five basic niche 'dimensions', or aspects: habitat, life history, trophic, defence and metabolic. Resultant patterns then are integrated to produce interpretable niche gradients, ordinations and classifications. Degree of scheme periodicity would depend on degrees of niche conservatism and convergence causing species clustering across multiple niche dimensions. We analysed a sample data set containing trait and performance data to contrast two approaches for producing niche schemes: species ordination within niche gradient space, and niche categorisation according to trait-value thresholds. Creation of niche schemes useful for advancing ecological knowledge and its applications will depend on research that produces functional trait and performance datasets directly related to niche dimensions along with criteria for data standardisation and quality. As larger databases are compiled, opportunities will emerge to explore new methods for data reduction, ordination and classification.},

abstract = {1. Most life-history models assume a trade-off between reproductive investment and parental survival. Several studies have documented reproductive costs in terms of reduced locomotor performance in terrestrial habitats. However, few studies have determined the reproductive costs of pregnancy in aquatic environments, or compared pregnancy-induced locomotor costs among habitats. This knowledge gap is important because many organisms rely on multiple habitat types during pregnancy. 2. We compared sexual differences in maximum locomotor velocity and the relative impacts of pregnancy on locomotor performance in aquatic and terrestrial environments for a semi-aquatic snake (Seminatrix pygaea). In addition, because most life-history models predict a direct trade-off between reproductive investment and reproductive costs, we quantified the relationship between reproductive investment and postpartum increase in velocity for both habitat types. 3. Both males and non-pregnant females always swam faster than they crawled, but males were significantly faster for their size than were non-pregnant females. These results mirror sexual differences known to exist in other snakes, but differ in that the degree of sexual divergence in velocity does not vary with habitat for S. pygaea. 4. Pregnancy significantly reduced both crawling and swimming velocity. Moreover, pregnancy impaired crawling velocity significantly more than swimming velocity. The mean (± 1 SE) percentage increases in crawling and swimming velocity after parturition were 72.8 ± 21.6 and 59.4 ± 12.8%, respectively. There was a direct trade-off between reproductive investment and aquatic locomotor impairment: snakes that invested more in offspring experienced larger decreases in swimming velocity. However, evidence for such a trade-off in the terrestrial habitat was weaker. 5. Our results demonstrate that the cost of reproduction for semi-aquatic organisms may differ between aquatic and terrestrial habitats in complex ways. Swimming may be more effective than crawling for escaping predators during pregnancy, because swimming results in faster velocities and is less impaired by pregnancy. However, the assumption of a direct trade-off between reproductive investment and locomotor impairment may be stronger for swimming performance compared with crawling performance. {\textcopyright} 2006 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {From 1988 to 1992 the north-central plains of North America had a drought that was followed by a wet period that continues to the present (1997). Data on the hydrology of the Cottonwood Lake area (CWLA) collected for nearly 10 years before, and during, the recent dry and wet periods indicate that some prairie pothole wetlands served only a recharge function under all climate conditions. Transpiration from groundwater around the perimeter of groundwater discharge wetlands drew water from the wetlands by the end of summer, even during very wet years. Long-term records of a climate index (Palmer Drought Severity Index), stream discharge (Pembina River), and lake level (Devils Lake) were used to put the 17-year CWLA record into a longer term perspective. In addition, proxy records of climate determined from fossils in the sediments of Devils Lake were also used. These data indicate that the drought of 1988-92 may have been the second worst of the 20th century, but that droughts of that magnitude, and worse, were common during the past 500 years. In contrast, the present wet period may be the wettest it has been during the past 130 years, or possibly the past 500 years.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that snakes can use groundborne vibrations for localizing prey, and some have proposed that such vibrations provide important cues for cottonmouth snakes while foraging on fish that fall from island bird rookeries. The latter hypothesis was tested by using fish and fish models to study the behavioral response of insular Agkistrodon piscivorus conanti to groundborne vibrations and olfactory cues. Diving and wading birds that nest on Seahorse Key, a small island adjacent to the northern Florida peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico, regularly drop fish in the vicinity of resident A. piscivorus during the colonial nesting period. Here we report that presentation of an equivalent groundborne vibration, without associated chemosensory or visual stimuli, failed to induce overt foraging behavior in these snakes. However, presentation of a fish-based olfactory stimulus, without associated groundborne vibration or motion, triggered a foraging response in A. piscivorus. Snakes from two study sites reacted differently to the olfactory stimulus; those from the site with less ground cover, more rats, and fewer snakes exhibited a weaker foraging response.},

abstract = {Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are increasingly prevalent in the environment and the evidence demonstrates that they affect reproductive health, has been accumulating for the last few decades. In this review of recent literature, we present evidence of the effects of estrogen-mimicking EDCs on female reproductive health especially the ovaries and uteri. As representative EDCs, data from studies with a pharmaceutical estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), an organochlorine pesticide methoxychlor (MXC), a phytoestrogen (genistein), and a chemical used in plastics, bisphenol a (BPA) have been presented. We also discuss the effects of a commonly found plasticizer in the environment, a phthalate (DEHP), even though it is not a typical estrogenic EDC. Collectively, these studies show that exposures during fetal and neonatal periods cause developmental reprogramming leading to adult reproductive disease. Puberty, estrous cyclicity, ovarian follicular development, and uterine functions are all affected by exposure to these EDCs. Evidence that epigenetic modifications are involved in the progression to adult disease is also presented.},
